# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Update ICONS constant to use PNG image paths

  - Modify the ICONS constant in src/maze.ts to reference PNG files instead of emoji characters
  - Ensure all image paths correctly map to files in the public folder (note: Empty.png vs empty)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.1_

- [x] 2. Implement image-based Cell component rendering

  - Modify the Cell component in src/App.tsx to use CSS background-image instead of text content
  - Add inline styles for backgroundImage, backgroundSize, backgroundPosition, and backgroundRepeat
  - Remove emoji text content from the cell div
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.1_

- [x] 3. Enhance CSS for image display and fallback support

  - Update src/maze.css to add background-size, background-position, and background-repeat properties to .cell class
  - Maintain existing background-color properties as fallbacks for loading states
  - Ensure 32x32 pixel sizing is preserved for proper image display
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 4.1_

- [x] 4. Implement image preloading system

  - Create a preloadImages function that loads all PNG assets before game initialization
  - Add the preloading call to the App component's useEffect hook
  - Ensure preloading doesn't block initial game rendering
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 5. Add error handling for image loading failures




  - Implement onError handling for background images using CSS fallback mechanism
  - Add console warnings for failed image loads
  - Ensure game remains playable when images fail to load
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 6. Create unit tests for image system
  - Write tests for the updated ICONS constant to verify correct image paths
  - Test Cell component rendering with image backgrounds
  - Mock image loading scenarios to test error handling
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 4.1_

- [ ] 7. Implement integration tests for full maze rendering
  - Create tests that render the complete maze with all cell types
  - Verify that all images display correctly in the grid layout
  - Test responsive behavior with image assets
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 2.2_

- [ ] 8. Add performance tests for image loading
  - Create tests to measure image loading performance
  - Monitor memory usage with image assets
  - Verify no rendering delays during gameplay
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 9. Validate asset integration in build system
  - Test that all PNG images are properly included in the production build
  - Verify image paths resolve correctly in both development and production environments
  - Ensure Vite properly handles and optimizes the image assets
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 10. Create visual regression tests
  - Implement screenshot-based tests to compare before/after visual appearance
  - Test across different screen sizes and orientations
  - Verify consistent appearance across different browsers
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3_
