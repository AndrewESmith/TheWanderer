# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature upgrades the maze game's visual representation from emoji-based icons to high-quality 32x32 pixel PNG images. The current system uses Unicode emoji characters which can appear inconsistently across different devices and browsers. By switching to PNG images, we ensure consistent visual presentation and improved game aesthetics across all platforms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see consistent, high-quality graphics for all game elements, so that the game looks professional and visually appealing regardless of my device or browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads THEN the system SHALL display PNG images instead of emoji characters for all maze elements
2. WHEN a cell contains any game element THEN the system SHALL render the corresponding 32x32 pixel PNG image
3. WHEN the game runs on different browsers and devices THEN the graphics SHALL appear identical and consistent

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game graphics to load quickly and efficiently, so that my gameplay experience is smooth and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game initializes THEN the system SHALL preload all required PNG images
2. WHEN switching between different maze elements THEN the system SHALL display images without loading delays
3. WHEN the game is built for production THEN all PNG assets SHALL be properly bundled and optimized

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the graphics system to be maintainable and extensible, so that adding new visual elements in the future is straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the image system THEN the code SHALL maintain the existing ICONS constant structure for backward compatibility
2. WHEN a new game element is added THEN the system SHALL support adding new PNG images through the same pattern
3. WHEN the graphics system is updated THEN existing game logic SHALL continue to function without modification

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want proper fallback handling for graphics, so that the game remains playable even if images fail to load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image fails to load THEN the system SHALL display a fallback representation
2. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the game SHALL still be playable with appropriate visual feedback
3. WHEN an image is missing THEN the system SHALL log an error and continue functioning

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build system to properly handle image assets, so that the game can be deployed successfully to production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is built THEN all PNG images SHALL be included in the distribution bundle
2. WHEN the game is deployed THEN image paths SHALL resolve correctly in the production environment
3. WHEN using the development server THEN images SHALL load properly from the public folder
