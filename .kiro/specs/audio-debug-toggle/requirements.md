# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will add a toggle control to the Audio Settings panel that allows developers to show or hide the Audio Debug Panel. The Audio Debug Panel is currently always visible in development mode, but developers should have the option to hide it when it's not needed to reduce visual clutter while still maintaining access to debugging capabilities when required.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to toggle the visibility of the Audio Debug Panel from the Audio Settings, so that I can reduce visual clutter when debugging audio is not needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Audio Settings panel is open THEN the system SHALL display a checkbox labeled "Show Audio Debug Panel"
2. WHEN the checkbox is checked THEN the Audio Debug Panel SHALL be visible on the screen
3. WHEN the checkbox is unchecked THEN the Audio Debug Panel SHALL be hidden from view
4. WHEN the game starts THEN the Audio Debug Panel SHALL be hidden by default and teh checkbox is unchecked

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my Audio Debug Panel visibility preference to persist across browser sessions, so that I don't have to reconfigure it every time I reload the page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I check the "Show Audio Debug Panel" checkbox THEN the preference SHALL be saved to localStorage
2. WHEN I uncheck the "Show Audio Debug Panel" checkbox THEN the preference SHALL be saved to localStorage
3. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL restore the Audio Debug Panel visibility from localStorage
4. IF no preference exists in localStorage THEN the Audio Debug Panel SHALL default to hidden

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Audio Debug Panel toggle to only appear in development mode, so that production builds don't expose debugging controls to end users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is running in development mode THEN the "Show Audio Debug Panel" checkbox SHALL be visible in Audio Settings
2. WHEN the application is running in production mode THEN the "Show Audio Debug Panel" checkbox SHALL not be rendered
3. WHEN the application is running in production mode THEN the Audio Debug Panel SHALL never be visible regardless of stored preferences

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Audio Debug Panel toggle to integrate seamlessly with the existing audio settings system, so that it follows the same patterns and styling as other audio controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the "Show Audio Debug Panel" checkbox is displayed THEN it SHALL use the same styling as the existing mute toggle
2. WHEN the Audio Settings are reset to defaults THEN the Audio Debug Panel visibility SHALL also reset to hidden
3. WHEN the audio settings hook manages state THEN it SHALL include the debug panel visibility state
4. WHEN the checkbox is interacted with THEN it SHALL provide the same visual feedback as other controls
