# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create core level management interfaces and types

  - Define MazeLevelData interface with level number, maze layout, move limit, and element counts
  - Create MazeLevelManager interface for level navigation and management
  - Add LevelProgressionResult interface for handling level transitions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 2. Implement MazeLevelManager class

  - Create MazeLevelManager class that manages array of level configurations
  - Implement getCurrentLevel(), hasNextLevel(), advanceToNextLevel() methods
  - Add level validation logic to ensure data integrity
  - Create initial 5-level configuration with existing maze as level 1
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 4.1, 4.3_

- [x] 3. Create level data configuration


  - Define MAZE_LEVELS array with 5 distinct maze layouts
  - Ensure each level has unique path layouts and proper element distribution
  - Set appropriate move limits for each level (varying difficulty)
  - Validate that each maze has exactly 1 exit and proper element counts
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6_

- [x] 4. Extend GameState for level management

  - Add currentLevel, levelManager, and isGameComplete properties to GameStateData
  - Modify createInitialGameState to initialize with level 1 from MazeLevelManager
  - Update GameState interface to expose level-related properties
  - Ensure score persistence across level transitions
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 3.1, 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 5. Implement level progression logic

  - Create LevelProgressionHandler class to manage level transitions
  - Add level completion detection when player reaches exit
  - Implement logic to determine next level or game completion
  - Add sound event generation for door slam vs victory sounds
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 6. Integrate level progression with player movement

  - Modify movePlayer function to detect level completion
  - Add level transition logic when player exits current level
  - Ensure proper sound triggering (door slam for next level, victory for completion)
  - Update game state to reflect new level data and reset move counter
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 1.5, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 7. Update UI to display level information

  - Add current level number to HUD display
  - Show level-specific move limits in the moves counter
  - Ensure score display shows cumulative total across all levels
  - Add visual indication of level progression
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 5.3_

- [x] 8. Create comprehensive unit tests for level management

  - Test MazeLevelManager level navigation and validation
  - Test level progression logic and sound event generation
  - Test GameState integration with level management
  - Verify score persistence and move limit resets
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 3.3, 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 9. Implement integration tests for level transitions

  - Test complete level progression from level 1 to final level
  - Verify proper audio triggering during level transitions
  - Test score accumulation across multiple levels
  - Validate game completion detection and victory sound
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.4_

- [x] 10. Add error handling and validation

  - Implement error handling for invalid level data
  - Add fallback mechanisms for level loading failures
  - Create validation for maze integrity and element counts
  - Add error recovery for level transition failures
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 11. Create end-to-end tests for complete game flow





  - Test full game playthrough from level 1 to completion
  - Verify all level transitions work correctly with proper sounds
  - Test edge cases like running out of moves on different levels
  - Validate final score calculation and game completion
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 5.4_

- [ ] 12. Optimize performance and finalize implementation
  - Optimize level loading and transition performance
  - Add any missing error handling or edge case coverage
  - Ensure all tests pass and code follows TypeScript standards
  - Verify extensibility for adding future levels
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_
