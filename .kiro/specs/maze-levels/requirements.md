# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces multiple maze levels to the existing game, allowing players to progress through a series of increasingly challenging mazes. The current single maze becomes level 1, and players advance through numbered levels with unique layouts, different numbers of game elements, and individual move limits while maintaining their cumulative score across all levels.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to progress through multiple maze levels, so that I can experience varied gameplay and increasing challenge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL load maze level 1 (the existing maze)
2. WHEN a player completes a maze level AND there is a next level available THEN the system SHALL play the door slam sound and load the next maze level
3. WHEN a player completes the final maze level THEN the system SHALL play the victory sound
4. WHEN transitioning between levels THEN the system SHALL maintain the player's cumulative score
5. WHEN a new level loads THEN the system SHALL reset the move counter for that level's specific move limit

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want each maze level to have unique characteristics, so that each level feels distinct and challenging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a maze level is generated THEN the system SHALL ensure it has the same outer dimensions as all other levels
2. WHEN a maze level is generated THEN the system SHALL create a unique path layout different from other levels
3. WHEN a maze level is generated THEN the system SHALL place between 1 and 3 bombs randomly within the maze
4. WHEN a maze level is generated THEN the system SHALL place between 1 and 10 diamonds randomly within the maze
5. WHEN a maze level is generated THEN the system SHALL place exactly 1 exit in the maze
6. WHEN a maze level is generated THEN the system SHALL place between 1 and 6 rocks randomly within the maze

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want each maze level to have its own move limit, so that I face appropriate challenges for each level's complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a maze level loads THEN the system SHALL display the move limit specific to that level
2. WHEN a player makes a move THEN the system SHALL decrement the current level's remaining moves
3. WHEN a player exceeds the move limit for a level THEN the system SHALL trigger the appropriate game over condition
4. WHEN transitioning to a new level THEN the system SHALL reset the move counter to the new level's move limit

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a game administrator, I want the system to support adding more maze levels in the future, so that the game can be expanded without major code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is designed THEN it SHALL use a scalable architecture that allows adding new maze levels
2. WHEN new maze levels are added THEN the system SHALL automatically include them in the level progression
3. WHEN the system loads levels THEN it SHALL dynamically determine the total number of available levels
4. WHEN the system processes level data THEN it SHALL handle variable numbers of levels without hardcoded limits

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want my score to persist across all maze levels, so that I can see my cumulative achievement throughout the entire game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player collects diamonds in any level THEN the system SHALL add the points to the cumulative score
2. WHEN a player transitions between levels THEN the system SHALL maintain the total score from previous levels
3. WHEN the game displays the score THEN it SHALL show the cumulative score across all completed and current levels
4. WHEN the game ends (victory or game over) THEN the system SHALL display the final cumulative score
