# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature refines the boulder behavior system in The Wanderer maze game to implement precise movement mechanics, audio feedback, and player interaction constraints. The current boulder system needs enhancement to provide a more engaging and predictable gameplay experience where boulders respond to player proximity with specific movement patterns, audio cues, and collision handling that affects both gameplay flow and player safety.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want boulders to move predictably when I'm near them, so that I can strategically plan my movements and understand the consequences of my actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player moves into a cell adjacent to a boulder THEN the system SHALL mark that boulder as "triggered" for movement on the player's next move
2. WHEN a player makes their next move after triggering a boulder THEN the boulder SHALL begin moving downward
3. WHEN a boulder begins moving THEN the system SHALL play the BOULDER_MOVE sound effect
4. WHEN a boulder is moving THEN it SHALL continue moving downward until it collides with another object
5. IF a boulder is not adjacent to a player THEN the boulder SHALL remain stationary

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to hear audio feedback when boulders move and collide, so that I can understand what's happening in the game even when not directly looking at the boulder.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a boulder starts moving THEN the system SHALL play the BOULDER_MOVE sound effect at 0.8 volume
2. WHEN a boulder collides with any object (rock, soil, diamond, bomb, arrow, or player) THEN the system SHALL play the COLLISION_THUD sound effect
3. WHEN multiple boulders are moving simultaneously THEN each boulder SHALL trigger its own sound effects independently
4. IF audio is muted globally THEN boulder sound effects SHALL respect the mute setting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to prevent me from moving while boulders are in motion, so that the game mechanics remain fair and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any boulder on the maze is moving THEN the system SHALL disable player movement input
2. WHEN all boulders have stopped moving THEN the system SHALL re-enable player movement input
3. WHEN player movement is disabled due to boulder movement THEN visual input indicators SHALL remain responsive but not trigger movement
4. WHEN a boulder stops moving due to collision THEN the system SHALL check if any other boulders are still moving before re-enabling player input

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want boulders to cause death when they hit me, so that there are meaningful consequences for poor positioning and timing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a moving boulder collides with the player THEN the player SHALL die immediately
2. WHEN a player dies from boulder collision THEN the system SHALL play the DEATH_SOUND effect
3. WHEN a player dies from boulder collision THEN the game SHALL end and display appropriate game over state
4. WHEN a boulder hits a player THEN the boulder SHALL stop moving at the player's position

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want boulders to interact properly with other game objects, so that the game world feels consistent and logical.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a boulder collides with a rock THEN the boulder SHALL stop moving
2. WHEN a boulder collides with soil THEN the boulder SHALL stop moving
3. WHEN a boulder collides with a diamond THEN the boulder SHALL stop moving
4. WHEN a boulder collides with a bomb THEN the boulder SHALL stop moving AND the bomb SHALL explode
5. WHEN a boulder collides with an arrow THEN the boulder SHALL stop moving
6. WHEN a boulder collides with another boulder THEN both boulders SHALL stop moving
7. WHEN a boulder collides with the exit THEN the boulder SHALL stop moving

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the boulder system to integrate seamlessly with the existing game architecture, so that it doesn't break existing functionality or create performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the boulder system is active THEN it SHALL not interfere with existing player movement mechanics when no boulders are triggered
2. WHEN the boulder system processes movement THEN it SHALL complete within the same game tick as other object updates
3. WHEN multiple boulders are triggered simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle all boulder movements efficiently without performance degradation
4. WHEN the game state is saved or loaded THEN boulder movement states SHALL be properly preserved
5. IF the boulder system encounters an error THEN it SHALL fail gracefully without crashing the game
