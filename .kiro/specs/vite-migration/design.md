# Design Document: Migrating from React Scripts to Vite

## Overview

This document outlines the design for migrating the project from React Scripts to Vite. The migration will involve replacing the build system, development server, and test runner while maintaining all existing functionality. Vite will provide faster development experience, improved build performance, and better compatibility with modern JavaScript features.

## Architecture

The current architecture uses Create React App (react-scripts) for building and serving the application, with Vitest for testing. The migration will replace react-scripts with Vite while keeping Vitest as the testing framework. The overall application architecture will remain unchanged, but the build and development tooling will be replaced.

### Current Architecture

```
React App (CRA)
├── react-scripts (build, dev server)
├── Vitest (testing)
└── Jest dependencies (causing conflicts)
```

### Target Architecture

```
React App (Vite)
├── Vite (build, dev server)
└── Vitest (testing)
```

## Components and Interfaces

### Build System

- **Current:** react-scripts build
- **Target:** Vite build
- **Changes:** 
  - Replace webpack configuration with Vite configuration
  - Update build output directory from `build` to `dist` (Vite default)
  - Configure asset handling in Vite

### Development Server

- **Current:** react-scripts start
- **Target:** Vite dev server
- **Changes:**
  - Replace webpack dev server with Vite dev server
  - Configure HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
  - Update proxy configuration if needed

### Testing Framework

- **Current:** Vitest with Jest dependencies causing conflicts
- **Target:** Vitest standalone
- **Changes:**
  - Remove all Jest dependencies
  - Configure Vitest to work with Vite
  - Update test setup files

### CSS Processing

- **Current:** CSS imports in JS files processed by webpack
- **Target:** CSS imports processed by Vite
- **Changes:**
  - Ensure CSS modules work correctly
  - Configure CSS preprocessing if needed

### Environment Variables

- **Current:** CRA-style environment variables (REACT_APP_*)
- **Target:** Vite-style environment variables (VITE_*)
- **Changes:**
  - Update environment variable naming
  - Configure .env files for Vite

## Data Models

No changes to data models are required for this migration. The application's internal data structures and state management will remain unchanged.

## Error Handling

Error handling will be updated to accommodate Vite's error reporting format. Vite provides more detailed error messages in the browser and terminal, which will improve the development experience.

## Testing Strategy

The testing strategy will be updated to fully leverage Vitest without Jest dependencies:

1. Remove all Jest-related dependencies and configurations
2. Configure Vitest to work with Vite
3. Update test setup files to handle CSS imports
4. Ensure VS Code Test Explorer works correctly with Vitest

## Migration Strategy

The migration will follow these steps:

1. Create a new branch for the migration
2. Install Vite and related dependencies
3. Create Vite configuration files
4. Update package.json scripts
5. Adjust import paths and environment variables
6. Test the application in development mode
7. Build the application and verify the output
8. Run tests and fix any issues
9. Update documentation
10. Merge the migration branch
