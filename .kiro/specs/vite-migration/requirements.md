# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the project from React Scripts to Vite. The migration aims to improve development experience, build performance, and resolve testing conflicts between Jest and Vitest. Vite offers faster development server startup, hot module replacement, and better compatibility with modern JavaScript features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from React Scripts to Vite, so that I can have a faster development experience and resolve testing conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the development server is started THEN the application SHALL load using Vite instead of React Scripts
2. WHEN code changes are made THEN the application SHALL update using Vite's hot module replacement
3. WHEN the build command is run THEN the application SHALL be built using Vite's build process
4. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL execute using Vitest without Jest conflicts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain all existing functionality after migration, so that the user experience remains unchanged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is loaded THEN all existing features SHALL work as they did before migration
2. WHEN the application is built THEN all assets SHALL be properly included in the build
3. WHEN CSS files are imported THEN they SHALL be properly processed and applied
4. WHEN environment variables are used THEN they SHALL be accessible in the same way as before

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a streamlined testing setup with Vitest, so that I can run tests without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are run from the command line THEN they SHALL execute successfully
2. WHEN tests are run from VS Code Test Explorer THEN they SHALL execute without Jest conflicts
3. WHEN CSS files are imported in test files THEN they SHALL be properly mocked
4. WHEN test coverage is measured THEN it SHALL provide accurate results

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation on the new setup, so that I can understand how to work with the migrated project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN looking at the README THEN it SHALL contain updated instructions for development, building, and testing
2. WHEN examining the package.json THEN it SHALL have clear scripts for all common operations
3. WHEN new developers join the project THEN they SHALL be able to set up the development environment easily
