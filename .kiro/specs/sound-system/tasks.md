  - Write unit tests for sound event generation
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 3.1, 3.3, 6.2_

- [x] 5. Implement collision and interaction sound effects

  - Add sound event detection for boulder movement and collisions
  - Implement arrow movement and collision sound triggers
  - Create sound events for object interactions (boulder hits rock, arrow hits soil)
  - Write integration tests for collision sound timing
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 6. Add game state change sound effects

  - Implement death sound when player hits bomb or runs out of moves
  - Add victory sound for successful exit completion
  - Create door slam sound for exit interaction
  - Ensure all movement sounds stop when game ends
  - Write tests for game state sound transitions
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.4_

- [x] 7. Create sound asset loading and management system

  - Implement preloading system for all game sound files
  - Add support for multiple audio formats (MP3/OGG) with fallbacks
  - Create audio file optimization and compression utilities
  - Add loading state management and error recovery
  - Write tests for asset loading and format fallback
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 7.2, 7.3_

- [x] 8. Implement audio settings and user controls

  - Add mute/unmute functionality with keyboard shortcut
  - Create persistent storage for audio preferences
  - Implement volume control system for different sound categories
  - Add audio settings UI components if needed
  - Write tests for settings persistence and user controls
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 9. Add comprehensive error handling and fallbacks


  - Implement graceful degradation when Web Audio API is unavailable
  - Add error recovery for failed sound file loads
  - Create silent mode fallback for unsupported browsers
  - Handle audio context suspension due to autoplay policies
  - Write tests for error scenarios and fallback behavior
  - _Requirements: 4.4, 5.4, 6.3_

- [ ] 10. Integrate sound system with main App component






  - Add sound hooks to App.tsx for global audio management
  - Connect keyboard event handlers to trigger appropriate sounds
  - Implement sound initialization during app startup
  - Ensure sound system doesn't block game rendering or input
  - Write integration tests for complete sound system functionality
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 4.4, 6.1_

- [ ] 11. Create comprehensive test suite for sound system
  - Write unit tests for all pure functions and sound event generation
  - Add integration tests for React hooks and component interactions
  - Create mock implementations for Web Audio API testing
  - Implement end-to-end tests for complete sound workflows
  - Add performance tests to ensure audio doesn't impact game responsiveness
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3, 6.3, 6.4_

- [ ] 12. Optimize performance and finalize implementation
  - Implement audio pooling to prevent memory leaks
  - Add audio buffer management and cleanup
  - Optimize sound file sizes and loading strategies
  - Ensure cross-browser compatibility and testing
  - Create documentation for sound system usage and configuration
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 7.1, 7.4_
