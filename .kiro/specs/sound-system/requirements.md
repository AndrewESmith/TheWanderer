# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The sound system will enhance The Wanderer game by providing audio feedback for all game events and player interactions. This system will integrate seamlessly with the existing functional React/TypeScript architecture while maintaining performance and providing an immersive retro gaming experience that matches the original Amiga game aesthetic.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to hear sound effects when game objects move, so that I can better understand the game state and feel more immersed in the gameplay experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a boulder moves THEN the system SHALL play a whoosh sound effect
2. WHEN an arrow moves THEN the system SHALL play a twang sound effect
3. WHEN the player moves THEN the system SHALL play a walking sound effect
4. WHEN the player enters a soil cell THEN the system SHALL play a digging sound effect

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to hear collision sounds when objects interact, so that I can understand when impacts occur without relying solely on visual feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a boulder hits a rock, boulder, arrow, or soil THEN the system SHALL play a thud sound effect
2. WHEN an arrow hits a rock, arrow, boulder, or soil THEN the system SHALL play a thud sound effect
3. WHEN any collision occurs THEN the sound SHALL play immediately upon impact detection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to hear distinct sounds for game state changes, so that I can understand important game events like winning or losing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player dies THEN the system SHALL play a "whaaa" death sound effect
2. WHEN the player enters the exit cell THEN the system SHALL play a door slam sound effect
3. WHEN the player collects a diamond THEN the system SHALL play a collection sound effect
4. WHEN the game ends (win or lose) THEN all movement sounds SHALL stop immediately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want the sound system to be performant and not impact game responsiveness, so that the audio enhances rather than detracts from the gameplay experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sounds are loaded THEN they SHALL be preloaded during game initialization
2. WHEN multiple sounds play simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle audio mixing without performance degradation
3. WHEN the same sound plays repeatedly THEN the system SHALL prevent audio clipping and overlap issues
4. WHEN sounds are played THEN they SHALL not block game state updates or user input

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want control over the game's audio settings, so that I can customize my gaming experience according to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL provide a way to mute/unmute all sounds
2. WHEN audio is muted THEN no sound effects SHALL play but the game SHALL continue to function normally
3. WHEN audio settings change THEN the preference SHALL persist across game sessions
4. IF the browser doesn't support audio THEN the game SHALL continue to work without sound

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the sound system to integrate cleanly with the existing functional architecture, so that it maintains code quality and testability standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing sound functionality THEN it SHALL use TypeScript interfaces for type safety
2. WHEN sound events occur THEN they SHALL be triggered through pure functions without side effects in game logic
3. WHEN testing the game THEN sound functionality SHALL be mockable for unit tests
4. WHEN sounds are managed THEN the system SHALL follow the existing functional programming patterns

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want the sound effects to match the retro gaming aesthetic, so that the audio complements the visual style and maintains the authentic Amiga game feel.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sound effects are selected THEN they SHALL have a retro/8-bit quality appropriate for the game's aesthetic
2. WHEN sounds play THEN they SHALL be optimized for web delivery (small file sizes, appropriate formats)
3. WHEN multiple sound effects are used THEN they SHALL have consistent audio levels and quality
4. WHEN sounds are implemented THEN they SHALL use web-compatible formats (MP3/OGG) with fallbacks
