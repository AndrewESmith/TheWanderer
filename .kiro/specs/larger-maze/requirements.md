# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current maze in the game is too small, limiting the gameplay possibilities and making it difficult to add more game elements like bombs, boulders, arrows, and logs. This feature aims to increase the maze size by 2 times in both dimensions, providing more space for gameplay elements and creating a more engaging player experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want a larger maze to explore, so that I have more room for movement and strategic gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads THEN the maze SHALL be 2 times larger in both width and height compared to the current implementation.
2. WHEN the maze is enlarged THEN the grid layout SHALL maintain the same cell size and appearance.
3. WHEN the maze is enlarged THEN the game SHALL maintain the same gameplay mechanics and rules.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a game designer, I want more space in the maze to place additional game elements, so that I can create more complex and interesting levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the maze is enlarged THEN it SHALL accommodate more game elements like bombs, boulders, arrows, and logs.
2. WHEN the maze is enlarged THEN the distribution of elements SHALL be balanced across the larger area.
3. WHEN the maze is enlarged THEN the game difficulty SHALL remain appropriate for players.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the enlarged maze to maintain compatibility with existing game mechanics, so that no functionality is broken by the size increase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the maze is enlarged THEN all existing game mechanics (movement, collecting diamonds, avoiding bombs, etc.) SHALL continue to function correctly.
2. WHEN the maze is enlarged THEN the player position tracking SHALL work correctly in the larger grid.
3. WHEN the maze is enlarged THEN the game performance SHALL not be significantly impacted.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want the user interface to adapt to the larger maze, so that I can still see the entire maze and game information clearly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the maze is enlarged THEN the UI SHALL adjust to display the entire maze appropriately.
2. WHEN the maze is enlarged THEN the game HUD (score, diamonds left, moves) SHALL remain visible and functional.
3. WHEN the maze is enlarged THEN the game SHALL be playable on standard screen sizes without requiring scrolling.
