# Design Document: Larger Maze Implementation

## Overview

This design document outlines the approach for enlarging the maze in the game by 2 times in both width and height. The current maze is 8x5 cells, and the new implementation will increase it to 16x10 cells. This change will provide more space for gameplay elements while maintaining the existing game mechanics and user experience.

## Architecture

The maze enlargement will primarily affect the following components:

1. **Maze Definition**: The `initialMaze` array in `maze.ts` will be expanded to accommodate the larger dimensions.
2. **CSS Grid Layout**: The grid template in `maze.css` will be updated to reflect the new dimensions.
3. **Game State Management**: The `GameState` class will continue to work with the larger maze without structural changes.
4. **UI Rendering**: The `App.tsx` component will automatically adapt to render the larger maze.

No architectural changes are required as the current implementation already supports variable-sized mazes. The changes will be limited to configuration values and content.

## Components and Interfaces

### Maze Component

The current maze implementation uses a 2D array to represent the maze grid. This approach will be maintained, but with an expanded array size. The interfaces (`IMaze`, `IGameState`, `IPlayerPos`) do not need modification as they are designed to work with mazes of any size.

```typescript
// Current initialMaze (8x5)
export const initialMaze: MazeCell[][] = [
  [CELL.ROCK, CELL.ROCK, CELL.ROCK, CELL.ROCK, CELL.ROCK, CELL.ROCK, CELL.ROCK, CELL.ROCK],
  [CELL.ROCK, CELL.SOIL, CELL.DIAMOND, CELL.EMPTY, CELL.BOULDER, CELL.SOIL, CELL.BOMB, CELL.ROCK],
  [CELL.ROCK, CELL.EMPTY, CELL.ROCK, CELL.EMPTY, CELL.ROCK, CELL.EMPTY, CELL.EMPTY, CELL.ROCK],
  [CELL.ROCK, CELL.PLAYER, CELL.EMPTY, CELL.DIAMOND, CELL.EMPTY, CELL.SOIL, CELL.EXIT, CELL.ROCK],
  [CELL.ROCK, CELL.ROCK, CELL.ROCK, CELL.ROCK, CELL.ROCK, CELL.ROCK, CELL.ROCK, CELL.ROCK],
];

// New initialMaze will be 16x10
```

### CSS Grid Layout

The CSS grid layout in `maze.css` will be updated to accommodate the larger maze:

```css
/* Current grid layout */
.maze-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(8, 32px);
  grid-template-rows: repeat(5, 32px);
  gap: 2px;
  background: #222;
  padding: 10px;
  width: max-content;
}

/* New grid layout will use repeat(16, 32px) for columns and repeat(10, 32px) for rows */
```

## Data Models

No changes to the data models are required. The existing models are designed to work with mazes of any size:

- `MazeCell`: Represents the type of cell in the maze (empty, player, rock, etc.)
- `IPlayerPos`: Represents the player's position in the maze
- `IGameState`: Manages the game state, including the maze, player position, score, etc.

## Error Handling

The existing error handling in the game is sufficient for the larger maze. The game already handles:

- Out-of-bounds movement attempts
- Invalid cell types
- Missing player position

No additional error handling is needed for the maze enlargement.

## Testing Strategy

The testing strategy will focus on ensuring that the larger maze functions correctly and maintains compatibility with existing game mechanics:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Verify that the player can move correctly in the larger maze
   - Ensure that game elements (diamonds, bombs, etc.) function as expected
   - Test boundary conditions at the edges of the larger maze

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test the complete game flow with the larger maze
   - Verify that the UI correctly displays the larger maze
   - Ensure that game state transitions (win, lose) work correctly

3. **Manual Testing**:
   - Verify that the game is playable and enjoyable with the larger maze
   - Check that the UI is responsive and displays correctly on different screen sizes
   - Ensure that the game performance is acceptable with the larger maze

## Design Decisions

### Maze Size

The decision to double the maze size (from 8x5 to 16x10) is based on:

1. Providing sufficient space for additional game elements
2. Maintaining a reasonable view on standard screen sizes
3. Keeping the game performance optimal

### Cell Size

The cell size (32px) will remain unchanged to maintain the visual consistency of the game. This ensures that game elements remain recognizable and the UI remains usable.

### Maze Layout

The new maze layout will follow the same pattern as the current maze, with:

- A border of rocks around the perimeter
- Strategic placement of game elements (diamonds, boulders, bombs, etc.)
- A single player starting position
- An exit that requires collecting all diamonds to use

### Game Balance

To maintain game balance with the larger maze:

- The number of diamonds will be increased proportionally
- The number of moves allowed will be adjusted to account for the larger maze
- The distribution of obstacles and hazards will be balanced to maintain an appropriate difficulty level

## Implementation Approach

The implementation will follow these steps:

1. Update the `initialMaze` array in `maze.ts` to the new dimensions (16x10)
2. Update the CSS grid layout in `maze.css` to match the new dimensions
3. Populate the larger maze with an appropriate distribution of game elements
4. Test the implementation to ensure compatibility with existing game mechanics
5. Adjust game parameters (moves, diamond count) if necessary for game balance
