# Input Delay Fix Summary

## Problem
The flickering fixes introduced performance optimizations that caused input delay:
- `React.useDeferredValue` was deferring player position updates
- `React.startTransition` was deprioritizing state updates
- Complex memoization logic was adding overhead

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Deferred Values
- Removed `React.useDeferredValue` for player position
- Player position now updates immediately on input

### 2. Removed Transition Wrapping
- Removed `React.startTransition` from state updates
- State updates now happen synchronously for immediate response

### 3. Simplified Cell Component
- Kept essential image caching to prevent flickering
- Removed complex image loading state management
- Simplified memoization comparison function
- Maintained structural maze optimization

### 4. Preserved Essential Optimizations
- Image caching system still prevents image reloading
- Maze structural comparison prevents unnecessary re-renders
- Cell memoization prevents flickering when only player moves

## Key Changes Made

```typescript
// BEFORE: Deferred updates causing delay
const deferredPlayerPosition = React.useDeferredValue(playerPosition);

// AFTER: Immediate updates for responsive input
const playerPosition = React.useState(() => gameState.player || { x: 0, y: 0 });
```

```typescript
// BEFORE: Transition wrapping causing delay
React.startTransition(() => {
  setPlayerPosition({ ...gameState.player });
});

// AFTER: Immediate state updates
setPlayerPosition({ ...gameState.player });
```

## Result
- Input now responds immediately to keypress
- Flickering is still prevented through image caching
- Game maintains smooth visual performance
- No more input delay while preserving anti-flickering benefits

The fix maintains the core flickering prevention (image caching and structural maze optimization) while removing the performance optimizations that were causing input delay.
