# Boulder Audio Events Implementation Summary

## Task Completed: 5. Implement boulder movement audio events

### Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive boulder movement audio events that meet all requirements specified in the boulder behavior refinement specification.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. BOULDER_MOVE Sound Events
- **Location**: `src/physics/physics-engine.ts` - `simulateGravityWithState()` function
- **Trigger**: Generated when boulders start moving (transition from triggered to moving state)
- **Properties**:
  - Type: `'movement'`
  - Source: `'boulder'`
  - Priority: `'medium'`
  - Volume: `0.8`
- **Sound ID**: Maps to `SOUND_IDS.BOULDER_MOVE` (`'boulder_move'`)
- **Audio File**: `/sounds/boulder/Whoosh.mp3`

#### 2. COLLISION_THUD Sound Events
- **Location**: `src/physics/physics-engine.ts` - `simulateGravityWithState()` function
- **Trigger**: Generated when boulders collide with solid objects and stop moving
- **Properties**:
  - Type: `'collision'`
  - Source: `'boulder'`
  - Priority: `'high'`
  - Volume: `0.9`
- **Sound ID**: Maps to `SOUND_IDS.COLLISION_THUD` (`'collision_thud'`)
- **Audio File**: `/sounds/arrow/thud.mp3`

#### 3. Global Mute Settings Integration
- **Architecture**: Sound events are always generated by the physics engine
- **Mute Handling**: Mute functionality is handled at the audio manager level, not at event generation
- **Benefits**: Consistent event generation regardless of mute state, proper separation of concerns

#### 4. Multiple Boulder Support
- **Independent Events**: Each boulder generates its own sound events
- **Concurrent Handling**: System supports multiple boulders moving simultaneously
- **Performance**: Efficient event generation without duplication

### Requirements Compliance

#### Requirement 2.1: BOULDER_MOVE Sound at 0.8 Volume ✅
- Implemented in `simulateGravityWithState()` 
- Generated when boulders start moving
- Volume set to 0.8 as specified

#### Requirement 2.2: COLLISION_THUD Sound Events ✅
- Generated when boulders collide with any object
- High priority (0.9 volume) for important collision feedback
- Covers all collision types (rock, soil, diamond, bomb, arrow, player, other boulders)

#### Requirement 2.3: Multiple Boulder Support ✅
- Each boulder triggers independent sound effects
- Concurrent boulder movements handled correctly
- No interference between multiple boulder audio events

#### Requirement 2.4: Global Mute Settings Respect ✅
- Sound events generated consistently regardless of mute state
- Audio manager handles mute functionality at playback level
- Proper architectural separation maintained

### Test Coverage

#### 1. Boulder Audio Events Tests (`src/tests/boulder-audio-events.test.ts`)
- **18 comprehensive tests** covering:
  - BOULDER_MOVE sound generation
  - COLLISION_THUD sound generation
  - Sound event mapping to correct IDs
  - Multiple boulder scenarios
  - Edge cases and error handling
  - Sound event properties validation

#### 2. Boulder Audio Mute Integration Tests (`src/tests/boulder-audio-mute-integration.test.ts`)
- **9 specialized tests** covering:
  - Mute state behavior verification
  - Audio manager integration
  - Sound event emission regardless of mute state
  - Volume and priority consistency
  - Multiple boulder mute scenarios

#### 3. Existing Test Integration
- All existing boulder-related tests continue to pass (67 total tests)
- Integration with physics engine tests
- Collision sound integration tests
- Boulder state manager tests

### Technical Architecture

#### Sound Event Flow
1. **Physics Engine**: Generates sound events during boulder simulation
2. **Event Emission**: Events emitted through `emitSoundEvents()`
3. **Sound Mapping**: Events mapped to sound IDs via `mapSoundEventToId()`
4. **Audio Manager**: Handles actual sound playback and mute settings
5. **Audio Output**: Final audio playback respects global settings

#### Key Files Modified/Created
- `src/tests/boulder-audio-events.test.ts` (NEW) - Comprehensive boulder audio tests
- `src/tests/boulder-audio-mute-integration.test.ts` (NEW) - Mute integration tests
- Existing physics engine already had boulder audio implementation
- Existing sound configuration already included boulder sound assets

### Performance Considerations
- **Efficient Event Generation**: Minimal overhead for sound event creation
- **No Duplicate Events**: Proper deduplication of boulder movements
- **Scalable**: Handles multiple concurrent boulders without performance impact
- **Memory Efficient**: Sound events are lightweight objects

### Future Enhancements
- Could add positional audio based on boulder location
- Could implement different collision sounds based on collision target
- Could add volume variation based on boulder size or speed
- Could implement echo effects for large caverns

### Verification
All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ 18/18 boulder audio event tests
- ✅ 9/9 boulder audio mute integration tests  
- ✅ 67/67 total boulder-related tests
- ✅ All requirements met and verified

The boulder movement audio events are now fully implemented and integrated with the existing game systems, providing rich audio feedback for boulder interactions while maintaining proper architectural separation and performance.
