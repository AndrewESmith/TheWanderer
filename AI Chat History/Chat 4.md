# Resolve module not found error

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Cannot find module './Interfaces/IGameState' or its corresponding type declarations.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

**Cursor**

The error occurs because there is no file named `IGameState.ts` in the `src/Interfaces/` directoryâ€”your project snapshot shows a file named just `IGameState` (no extension).

**How to fix:**
1. Rename the file from `IGameState` to `IGameState.ts` in the `src/Interfaces/` directory.

This will allow TypeScript to find and import the module correctly.

Can you help me implement the IGameState movePlayer method taking in account how it is used in App.tsx

---

**Cursor**

Here's how you can implement the `movePlayer` method for `IGameState`:

**How it is used:**  
In `App.tsx`, `movePlayer(dx, dy)` is called to update the player's position, score, diamonds, moves, and game state based on the cell the player moves to. It checks boundaries, cell types, and updates the maze and player state accordingly.

**How to implement:**  
- `movePlayer(dx: number, dy: number): void` should:
  1. Check if the game is still 'playing'.
  2. Calculate the new position.
  3. Check boundaries and cell type.
  4. Update score, diamonds, moves, and gameState as per the logic in `App.tsx`.
  5. Update the maze and player position.

**Concise next steps:**  
- Implement a class (e.g., `GameState`) that implements `IGameState` and contains the maze, player position, and the `movePlayer` logic as seen in `App.tsx`.
- The method should mutate the class's state (score, moves, diamonds, gameState) accordingly.

Would you like me to scaffold this class for you in `src/GameState.ts`?

```typescript
import { IGameState } from "./Interfaces/IGameState";
import { MazeCell, CELL, initialMaze } from "./maze";
import { IPlayerPos } from "./Interfaces/IPlayerPos";
import { PlayerPos } from "./PlayerPos";

export class GameState implements IGameState {
  maze: MazeCell[][];
  player: IPlayerPos | null;
  score: number;
  moves: number;
  diamonds: number;
  gameState: 'playing' | 'dead' | 'won';

  constructor() {
    // Deep copy the initial maze
    this.maze = initialMaze.map(row => [...row]);
    this.player = PlayerPos.getPlayerPos({
      getPlayerPos: () => {
        for (let y = 0; y < this.maze.length; y++) {
          for (let x = 0; x < this.maze[0].length; x++) {
            if (this.maze[y][x] === CELL.PLAYER) return { x, y };
          }
        }
        return null;
      }
    } as any);
    this.score = 0;
    this.diamonds = this.maze.flat().filter((c) => c === CELL.DIAMOND).length;
    this.moves = 1000;
    this.gameState = 'playing';
  }

  movePlayer(dx: number, dy: number): void {
    if (this.gameState !== 'playing' || !this.player) return;
    const { x, y } = this.player;
    const nx = x + dx;
    const ny = y + dy;
    if (
      ny < 0 ||
      ny >= this.maze.length ||
      nx < 0 ||
      nx >= this.maze[0].length
    )
      return;

    const target = this.maze[ny][nx];
    let newGameState: 'playing' | 'dead' | 'won' = this.gameState;

    // Blocked by rock or boulder
    if (target === CELL.ROCK || target === CELL.BOULDER) return;

    // Diamond: collect
    if (target === CELL.DIAMOND) {
      this.score += 10;
      this.diamonds -= 1;
    }

    // Soil: disappears
    if (target === CELL.SOIL || target === CELL.DIAMOND) {
      this.maze[ny][nx] = CELL.PLAYER;
      this.maze[y][x] = CELL.EMPTY;
    }
    // Bomb: die
    else if (target === CELL.BOMB) {
      this.maze[ny][nx] = CELL.PLAYER;
      this.maze[y][x] = CELL.EMPTY;
      newGameState = 'dead';
    }
    // Exit: only if all diamonds collected
    else if (target === CELL.EXIT) {
      if (this.diamonds === 0) {
        this.maze[ny][nx] = CELL.PLAYER;
        this.maze[y][x] = CELL.EMPTY;
        newGameState = 'won';
      } else {
        return;
      }
    }
    // Empty: just move
    else if (target === CELL.EMPTY) {
      this.maze[ny][nx] = CELL.PLAYER;
      this.maze[y][x] = CELL.EMPTY;
    }

    this.player = { x: nx, y: ny };
    this.moves -= 1;
    this.gameState = newGameState;
    if (this.moves <= 0 && this.gameState === 'playing') {
      this.gameState = 'dead';
    }
  }
}

```

The `GameState` class is now implemented in `src/GameState.ts`, matching the logic from `App.tsx` for `movePlayer`. It manages the maze, player position, score, diamonds, moves, and game state, and provides a `movePlayer(dx, dy)` method that updates all relevant state according to the game rules.

You can now use this class to encapsulate your game logic and state. If you need to connect it to your React components or need further adjustments, let me know!

Please help me connect GameState.ts to App.tsx

```typescriptreact
// ... existing code ...
import { GameState } from "./GameState";
// ... existing code ...
const MazeComponent: React.FC = () => {
  const [gameState, setGameState] = React.useState(new GameState());

  const movePlayer = React.useCallback(
    (dx: number, dy: number) => {
      // Call the GameState method
      gameState.movePlayer(dx, dy);
      // Force re-render by creating a new GameState reference (shallow copy)
      setGameState(Object.assign(Object.create(Object.getPrototypeOf(gameState)), gameState));
    },
    [gameState]
  );

  // Handle keyboard input
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const handleKey = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
      if (gameState.gameState !== 'playing') return;
      if (["ArrowUp", "w", "W"].includes(e.key)) movePlayer(0, -1);
      if (["ArrowDown", "s", "S"].includes(e.key)) movePlayer(0, 1);
      if (["ArrowLeft", "a", "A"].includes(e.key)) movePlayer(-1, 0);
      if (["ArrowRight", "d", "D"].includes(e.key)) movePlayer(1, 0);
    };
    window.addEventListener('keydown', handleKey);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKey);
  }, [movePlayer, gameState.gameState]);

  // Game over if out of moves
  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (gameState.moves <= 0 && gameState.gameState === 'playing') {
      gameState.gameState = 'dead';
      setGameState(Object.assign(Object.create(Object.getPrototypeOf(gameState)), gameState));
    }
  }, [gameState]);

  // Render cell (reuse previous Cell component)
  const Cell: React.FC<{ type: MazeCell }> = ({ type }) => {
    return (
      <div className={`cell ${type}`}>
        {ICONS[type]}
      </div>
    );
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <div className="maze-grid">
        {gameState.maze.map((row, y) =>
          row.map((cell, x) => <Cell key={`${y}-${x}`} type={cell} />)
        )}
      </div>
      <div className="hud">
        <span>Score: {gameState.score}</span>
        <span>Diamonds left: {gameState.diamonds}</span>
        <span>Moves: {gameState.moves}</span>
        <span>
          {gameState.gameState === 'dead' && 'Game Over'}
          {gameState.gameState === 'won' && 'You Win!'}
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
// ... existing code ...
```

Your `App.tsx` is now refactored to use the `GameState` class for all game logic and state. All state updates and rendering now reference the `gameState` instance, and player movement is handled via `gameState.movePlayer`.

**Summary of changes:**
- All individual state hooks (maze, player, score, diamonds, moves, gameState) are replaced by a single `useState` for a `GameState` instance.
- The `movePlayer` function calls `gameState.movePlayer(dx, dy)` and then triggers a re-render by updating the state with a new reference.
- The UI and keyboard handlers now use the properties and methods of the `GameState` instance.

You can now manage and extend your game logic in one place (`GameState.ts`). If you need further integration (e.g., reset, save/load), let me know!
