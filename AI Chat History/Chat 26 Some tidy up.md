stderr | src/tests/audio-manager.test.ts > Audio Manager > Error Handling > should handle HTTP errors during preloadingFailed to load DIAMOND_COLLECT from sounds/diamond/collect.mp3: Error: HTTP 404: Not Found

## Analysis and Solution

I identified that the test failure was due to a missing sound file. The error showed that the test was trying to load `sounds/diamond/collect.mp3` but getting a 404 error.

### Investigation Steps

1. **Checked the current test setup** - Read the audio manager test file to understand the failing test and how audio files are being loaded.

2. **Examined sound configuration** - Found that the sound configuration in `src/audio/config/sound-config.ts` references:
```typescript
DIAMOND_COLLECT: {
    id: 'diamond_collect',
    src: ['sounds/diamond/collect.mp3'], // replaced placeholder with collect.mp3
    volume: 0.7,
    loop: false,
    preload: true
}
```

3. **Checked file system structure** - Verified that the `public/sounds` directory existed but was missing the `diamond` subdirectory:
```
public/sounds/
├── arrow/
│   ├── thud.mp3
│   └── twang.mp3
├── boulder/
│   ├── thud.mp3
│   └── Whoosh.mp3
├── environment/
│   └── door-slam.mp3
└── player/
    ├── death.mp3
    ├── dig.mp3
    └── walk.mp3
```

### Solution Implementation

1. **Created missing directory**:
```cmd
mkdir public\sounds\diamond
```

2. **Created placeholder sound file**:
```cmd
copy public\sounds\player\walk.mp3 public\sounds\diamond\collect.mp3
```

3. **Verified the fix** - Ran the tests to confirm all 27 tests now pass.

### Test Results

After implementing the fix:
- ✅ All 27 tests in `src/tests/audio-manager.test.ts` are passing
- The error messages in stderr are expected behavior for error handling tests
- The audio system gracefully handles missing files with retry logic and proper error reporting

### Key Insights

The tests are designed to verify robust error handling:
- **Retry mechanism**: Shows "Retry 1/3", "Retry 2/3" for failed loads
- **Graceful degradation**: System continues working even when sounds fail to load
- **Proper logging**: Appropriate error messages are logged without crashing
- **Status reporting**: Final status shows "Asset loading complete: 0/9 loaded, 9 failed"

This demonstrates that the audio system has proper error handling that ensures the game continues to function even when sound assets are missing, which is exactly what good defensive programming should do.

## Technical Details

The issue was specifically with the `DIAMOND_COLLECT` sound asset configuration that expected a file at `sounds/diamond/collect.mp3` but the directory structure was incomplete. The tests were correctly identifying this missing asset and the error handling was working as designed.

The solution involved creating the missing directory structure and providing a placeholder audio file so that the configuration matches the expected file system layout.
