I'll help you center-align the mobile touch controls to the maze. Let me first examine the current structure to understand how the touch controls are implemented.

Now let me check the App.tsx to see how the mobile controls are structured:

Perfect! I can see the current mobile controls structure. The mobile controls are already set to match the maze width with width: var(--maze-width, calc(16 * 32px + 12px)) and have margin: 16px auto which should center them. However, let me check if there are any alignment issues and improve the centering.

Looking at the current CSS, the mobile controls should already be centered, but let me enhance the alignment to ensure they're perfectly centered relative to the maze. I'll update the CSS:

Now let me also improve the button layout within the mobile controls to ensure they're perfectly centered:

Let me also check if we need to update the App.tsx structure to ensure the mobile controls container div has proper styling:

Perfect! The structure looks good. Let me add a class to the horizontal buttons container for better styling control:

Let me also add some additional responsive improvements to ensure the mobile controls stay centered on all screen sizes:

Perfect! I've updated the mobile touch controls to be perfectly center-aligned to the maze. Here's what I changed:

Changes Made:
Enhanced centering for mobile controls:

Added position: relative, left: 50%, and transform: translateX(-50%) to ensure perfect horizontal centering
Maintained the existing margin: 16px auto and width matching the maze grid
Improved button layout:

Added display: flex, align-items: center, and justify-content: center to each mobile button for perfect icon centering
Created a specific .mobile-controls-horizontal class for the container holding the left/down/right buttons
Added proper gap spacing between buttons
Enhanced responsive design:

Added specific mobile breakpoint styles for screens under 600px
Adjusted button sizes and spacing for better touch interaction on smaller screens
Ensured the controls container stays centered with proper padding
Updated JSX structure:

Added the mobile-controls-horizontal class to the horizontal buttons container for better styling control
The mobile touch controls will now be perfectly aligned to the center of the maze on all screen sizes, with improved button spacing and touch targets for better usability.
