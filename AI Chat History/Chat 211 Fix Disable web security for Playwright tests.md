The error occurs because WebKit in GitHub Actions doesn't support the --disable-web-security flag that Playwright tries to use by default. This is a common issue with WebKit in CI environments.

Let me check your current Playwright configuration to provide the exact fix:

Now let me check the visual regression test file to see the exact test structure:

The issue is that WebKit in GitHub Actions doesn't support the --disable-web-security flag. Here's the fix:

Accepted edits to

playwright.config.ts


Why the error occurs:
WebKit in GitHub Actions doesn't support the --disable-web-security flag that works locally. This causes the browser launch to fail with "Cannot parse arguments: Unknown option --disable-web-security".

The fix:
The solution conditionally applies different launch arguments based on whether we're running in CI (GitHub Actions) or locally:

In CI: Only uses --force-color-profile=srgb which is supported
Locally: Keeps all the original flags including --disable-web-security for development
This approach maintains local development functionality while ensuring CI compatibility. The --force-color-profile=srgb flag helps with visual consistency across different environments, which is important for your visual regression tests.
