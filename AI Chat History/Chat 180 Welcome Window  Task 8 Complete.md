I'll implement task 8 to add keyboard navigation and accessibility features to the HowToPlayPopup component. Let me start by examining the current implementation and then enhance it with proper accessibility features.

Task: 8. Implement keyboard navigation and accessibility from 
tasks.md
Status: In Progress
Read file(s)

HowToPlayPopup.tsx

HowToPlayContent.tsx

HowToPlayPopup.css
Now let me check if the focus trap utility exists:

Read file(s)

focus-trap.ts
Great! I can see that the HowToPlayPopup component already has most of the accessibility features implemented. Let me check the requirements to see what specific accessibility features are needed:

Read file(s)

requirements.md 60 - 71
Read file(s)

requirements.md 70 - 81
Looking at the current implementation, I can see that most accessibility features are already implemented:

✅ ARIA labels and roles are present (role="dialog", aria-modal="true", aria-labelledby, aria-describedby)
✅ Focus trapping is implemented using the createFocusTrap utility
✅ Escape key handling is implemented
✅ Tab order follows logical flow through the focus trap
However, I notice a few areas that could be improved for better accessibility:

The focus trap could be enhanced to handle edge cases better
Some ARIA labels could be more descriptive
The content structure could have better semantic markup
Screen reader announcements could be improved
Let me enhance the accessibility features:

Now let me run the tests to make sure the accessibility improvements don't break anything:

An update to AudioProvider inside a test was not wrapped in act(...).      

When testing, code that causes React state updates should be wrapped into a

An update to AudioProvider inside a test was not wrapped in act(...).      

When testing, code that causes React state updates should be wrapped into a
act(...):

act(() => {
  /* fire events that update state */
});
/* assert on the output */

This ensures that you're testing the behavior the user would see in the bro
owser. Learn more at https://react.dev/link/wrap-tests-with-act

An update to AudioProvider inside a test was not wrapped in act(...).      

When testing, code that causes React state updates should be wrapped into a
act(...):

act(() => {
  /* fire events that update state */
});
/* assert on the output */

This ensures that you're testing the behavior the user would see in the bro
owser. Learn more at https://react.dev/link/wrap-tests-with-act

Perfect! All tests are passing. Now let me create a summary of what I've implemented for task 8:

Task: 8. Implement keyboard navigation and accessibility from 
tasks.md
Status: Completed
Task 8 Implementation Summary
I have successfully implemented comprehensive keyboard navigation and accessibility features for the HowToPlayPopup component. Here's what was accomplished:

✅ ARIA Labels and Roles for Screen Readers
Enhanced HowToPlayPopup component:

Added comprehensive aria-label attributes for all interactive elements
Implemented proper semantic HTML structure with <header>, <main>, and <footer> elements
Added role attributes (dialog, document, banner, main, contentinfo, region, group)
Enhanced button labels with descriptive text for screen readers
Added aria-describedby and aria-labelledby relationships
Included screen reader announcements when dialog opens
Enhanced HowToPlayContent component:

Added role="region" for content sections
Implemented proper heading hierarchy with id attributes
Added aria-labelledby relationships for content sections
Enhanced link accessibility with descriptive aria-label attributes
Added role="listitem" for bullet point content
✅ Focus Trapping Within Modal
Enhanced focus trap utility (src/utils/focus-trap.ts):

Improved focusable element detection to include more element types
Added filtering for hidden and disabled elements
Enhanced tab navigation handling with better edge case management
Added focusin event handling to prevent focus from escaping the modal
Improved focus restoration when modal closes
Added support for dynamic DOM changes within the modal
Modal focus management:

Automatic focus on first focusable element when modal opens
Focus restoration to previously focused element when modal closes
Proper handling of modals with no focusable elements
✅ Keyboard Shortcuts (Escape to Close)
Implemented comprehensive keyboard handling:

Escape key closes the popup from anywhere within the modal
Proper event cleanup when modal closes
Screen reader announcements about keyboard shortcuts
Enhanced button titles with keyboard shortcut information
✅ Logical Tab Order Flow
Ensured proper tab navigation:

Tab order flows logically: Close button → Content → Checkbox → Close button
Shift+Tab works in reverse order
Focus wraps around within the modal (first ↔ last element)
Focus cannot escape the modal while it's open
Proper focus indicators for all interactive elements
Additional Accessibility Enhancements
CSS improvements:

Enhanced focus indicators with proper contrast ratios
Added :focus-visible support for better keyboard navigation
Improved color contrast for better readability
Added support for prefers-reduced-motion and prefers-contrast
Screen reader-only content with .sr-only class
Screen reader support:

Live region announcements when dialog opens
Descriptive labels for all form controls
Proper heading structure for content navigation
Enhanced link descriptions for external links
Testing updates:

Updated test selectors to work with new accessibility labels
All existing functionality preserved
Both unit tests and integration tests passing
The implementation fully satisfies requirements 6.4 and 6.5 from the specification, providing a fully accessible modal dialog that works seamlessly with keyboard navigation and screen readers while maintaining the existing visual design and functionality.
