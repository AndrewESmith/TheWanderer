Now I understand the current structure. I need to enhance the physics engine to handle proximity-based boulder triggering. Based on the requirements and design, I need to:

Extend simulatePhysicsStep to handle proximity-based boulder triggering
Modify boulder movement logic to respect trigger conditions
Update physics simulation to track moving vs stationary boulders
Write unit tests for enhanced physics engine functionality
Let me start by enhancing the physics engine:

I need to fix several issues in my implementation. Let me analyze and fix them:

The collision detection logic isn't working properly
Player collision detection isn't working
The boulder categorization logic has issues
The triggered boulder logic isn't working as expected
Let me fix the simulateGravityWithState function:

Now I need to fix the player collision detection. The issue is that the player position check is happening after the maze is updated. Let me fix this:

Now I need to fix the boulder categorization issue. The problem is in the test logic. Let me check the getStationaryBoulderPositions function:

Let me check the getTriggeredBoulderPositions function:

The function doesn't exist! I need to add it to the boulder-state-manager.ts file. But first, let me understand the issue with the test. The problem is that a triggered boulder is also counted as stationary. Let me fix the logic:

Now I need to add the missing getTriggeredBoulderPositions function:

Perfect! All existing tests are still passing. Now let me verify that the requirements are met by checking against the task requirements:

Task Requirements Verification:
✅ Extend simulatePhysicsStep to handle proximity-based boulder triggering

Added simulatePhysicsStepWithState function that integrates with BoulderStateManager
Added simulateGravityWithState function that handles triggered boulders
✅ Modify boulder movement logic to respect trigger conditions

Implemented logic to get triggered boulders for specific move numbers
Only boulders that were triggered on the previous move start moving
Added proper sound generation for triggered boulders (BOULDER_MOVE sound)
✅ Update physics simulation to track moving vs stationary boulders

Added movingBoulders, completedBoulders, and playerCollisions to PhysicsSimulationResult
Implemented functions to categorize boulders: getMovingBoulderPositions, getStationaryBoulderPositions, getTriggeredBoulderPositions
Added categorizeBoulders function to get comprehensive boulder state information
Added shouldContinuePhysicsWithState to determine if physics should continue based on boulder states
✅ Write unit tests for enhanced physics engine functionality

Created comprehensive test suite in src/tests/physics-engine-enhanced.test.ts
Tests cover all major functionality including:
Triggered boulder movement with sound events
Boulder collision detection with COLLISION_THUD sounds
Player collision detection
Multiple boulder scenarios
Boulder state tracking functions
Edge cases and error handling
The enhanced physics engine now properly handles:

Requirement 1.2: Boulders begin moving downward when triggered (tested)
Requirement 1.3: Boulders play BOULDER_MOVE sound when starting to move (tested)
Requirement 6.2: System completes within the same game tick and handles multiple boulders efficiently (tested)
Task: 4. Enhance physics engine with boulder triggering from 
tasks.md
Status: Completed
Summary
I have successfully implemented task 4 to enhance the physics engine with boulder triggering. The implementation includes:

Key Features Added:
Enhanced Physics Simulation Result: Extended the PhysicsSimulationResult interface to include movingBoulders, completedBoulders, and playerCollisions arrays for better state tracking.

State-Aware Physics Functions:

simulateGravityWithState(): Handles boulder movement with state management
simulatePhysicsStepWithState(): Integrates boulder state management with physics simulation
Boulder State Tracking: Added functions to categorize and track boulder states:

getMovingBoulderPositions()
getStationaryBoulderPositions()
getTriggeredBoulderPositions()
categorizeBoulders()
shouldContinuePhysicsWithState()
Proximity-Based Triggering: The physics engine now respects boulder trigger conditions, only moving boulders that were triggered on the previous move.

Enhanced Audio Events:

BOULDER_MOVE sounds for newly triggered boulders
COLLISION_THUD sounds for boulder collisions
Proper volume and priority settings
Player Collision Detection: The system now detects when moving boulders collide with the player.

Testing:
Created a comprehensive test suite with 13 tests covering:

Triggered boulder movement and sound generation
Boulder collision detection and sound events
Player collision detection
Multiple boulder scenarios
Boulder state categorization
Edge cases and error handling
All tests pass, and existing physics tests continue to work, ensuring backward compatibility.

The enhanced physics engine is now ready to be integrated with the game state management system and provides the foundation for implementing the remaining boulder behavior features.
