The labels for the check sliders Mute All sounds and Show Audio Debug Panel are both obscurred by the slider graphic. The labels need to be moved to the right

I'll help you fix the label positioning for the audio settings sliders. Let me first examine the current AudioSettings component to see how the labels are positioned.

Read file(s)

AudioSettings.tsx
Now let me check the CSS file to see how the toggle sliders are currently styled:

Read file(s)

AudioSettings.css
I can see the issue! The toggle labels are positioned after the slider in the HTML structure, but the CSS is using margin-right: 12px on the .toggle-slider, which creates space to the right of the slider. However, since the text comes after the slider in the HTML, it's getting positioned too close to or overlapping with the slider graphic.

Let me fix this by adjusting the CSS to properly position the labels to the right of the sliders:

AudioSettings.css


The changes I made:

Replaced margin-right: 12px with gap: 12px on the toggle containers - This creates consistent spacing between the slider and label using flexbox gap, which is more reliable than margins.

Added flex-shrink: 0 to the .toggle-slider - This prevents the slider from shrinking if the label text is long, ensuring the slider maintains its proper size.

Used gap: 12px - This modern CSS property creates consistent spacing between flex items, ensuring the label text is properly positioned to the right of the slider with adequate spacing.

These changes will ensure that both the "Mute All Sounds" and "Show Audio Debug Panel" labels are properly positioned to the right of their respective slider graphics with consistent spacing, and they won't be obscured by the slider elements.


Now the labels are too far to the left and are completely hidden by the toggle. refer to image file `Mute All Sounds.png` for Mute All Sounds toggle and image file `Show Audio Debug Panel.png` for Show Audio Debug Panel

I can see from the images that the labels are indeed being hidden behind the toggle sliders. The issue is that the text is positioned behind the slider element. Let me read the current CSS file to see what happened after the autofix, then correct the positioning.

I can see the issue now. Looking at the images, the text is appearing behind the toggle slider. The problem is likely with the z-index or the order of elements. Let me check the HTML structure in the component again to understand the layout:

Now I understand the issue! The HTML structure has the text directly after the <span className="toggle-slider"></span> element, but the text is appearing behind the slider. The problem is that the .toggle-slider element might have a z-index or positioning issue that's causing it to overlay the text.

Looking at the images, I can see that the text is positioned where the slider circle is. The issue is that the gap: 12px is working, but the text is being rendered behind the slider element. Let me fix this by ensuring proper z-index and positioning:

Actually, let me also check if there's an issue with the text positioning. Let me add some specific styling to ensure the text is properly positioned:

Wait, I think I misunderstood the HTML structure. Let me check it again - the text is not in a span, it's directly in the label. Let me fix this properly:

Looking at the images more carefully, I think the issue might be that the text is being positioned absolutely or there's some other CSS interference. Let me try a different approach - let me wrap the text in a span and ensure proper positioning:

Now let me add CSS for the toggle label to ensure it's properly positioned:

Accepted edits to

AudioSettings.css


The changes I made:

Wrapped the text in <span className="toggle-label"> - This gives us better control over the text positioning
Added position: relative to the toggle containers - This establishes a positioning context
Added z-index: 1 to the toggle slider - This ensures it stays above background elements
Added specific styling for .toggle-label with position: relative and z-index: 2 - This ensures the text appears above the slider
Added proper color and font-size to the toggle label to match the design
This should fix the issue where the labels were being hidden behind the toggle sliders. The text should now appear properly to the right of each toggle with adequate spacing.

Label text for both toggles is still left justified. The label needs to be to the right of the slider toggle so that the slider image doesn't move over the label

I understand the issue now. The label text is still appearing to the left of or overlapping with the slider. Let me check the current state of the files and fix the positioning so the labels appear clearly to the right of the toggle sliders.

Good, I can see the structure is correct. The issue might be that the flexbox layout isn't working as expected. Let me try a different approach - I'll use a more explicit layout with proper spacing:

Accepted edits to

AudioSettings.css


I replaced the gap: 12px with margin-left: 12px on the .toggle-label and added flex: 1 to ensure the label takes up the remaining space. This should position the label text clearly to the right of the toggle slider with proper spacing.

The changes:

Removed gap: 12px - This wasn't working as expected
Added margin-left: 12px to .toggle-label - This creates explicit spacing between the slider and the text
Added flex: 1 to .toggle-label - This ensures the label takes up the remaining space and stays to the right
Removed z-index properties - These weren't needed for this layout approach
This should fix the positioning so that "Mute All Sounds" and "Show Audio Debug Panel" labels appear clearly to the right of their respective toggle sliders.

same issue remains

Let me take a screenshot to see the current state and then debug this step by step. First, let me check if there are any conflicting CSS rules or if the toggle slider has positioning that's causing the overlap.

Read file(s)

AudioSettings.css
I see the issue! There's a conflict between the general .setting-group label rule and our specific toggle styles. The .setting-group label has display: block which is overriding our display: flex on the toggle labels. Let me fix this by making the toggle styles more specific:

AudioSettings.css


Now let me also ensure the toggle slider positioning is correct and doesn't interfere with the text:


2 edits to file

AudioSettings.css


The key changes I made:

Added !important override for the toggle display property to ensure display: flex takes precedence over the general display: block rule
Used order: 1 and order: 2 to explicitly control the flex order - slider first, then label
Removed z-index from the slider since we're using flex order instead
This should resolve the CSS specificity conflict and ensure the toggle labels appear properly to the right of the sliders.

Thankyou issue is now resolved

Kiro
Perfect! I'm glad the issue is resolved. The problem was a CSS specificity conflict where the general .setting-group label rule with display: block was overriding our toggle-specific display: flex styling.

By adding the !important override and using explicit flex ordering with order: 1 and order: 2, we ensured that:

The toggle sliders display as flex containers properly
The slider appears first (order: 1)
The label text appears to the right with proper spacing (order: 2 and margin-left: 12px)
Now both "Mute All Sounds" and "Show Audio Debug Panel" labels should be clearly visible to the right of their respective toggle sliders without any overlap or positioning issues.
