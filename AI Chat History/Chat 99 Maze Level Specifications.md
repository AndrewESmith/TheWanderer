New Session





With reference to #Maze Levels.md I want to introduce maze levels to the game

Kiro
Including Steering Documents

typescript-standards.md
I'll help you create a spec for introducing maze levels to the game. Let me first check if there are any existing specs and then create a new one for this feature.

Searched workspace
Checking for existing specs to see if there's already a maze levels spec or if we need to create a new one
I can see there are existing specs but none for maze levels. Let me create a new spec for this feature. Based on your requirements, I'll call this feature "maze-levels".

Created

requirements.md


Do the requirements look good? If so, we can move on to the design.

Great! Now I'll move on to creating the design document. Let me first examine the current game structure to understand how to best implement the maze levels feature.

Read file(s)

maze.ts

GameState.ts

App.tsx
Now let me examine the audio system to understand how sounds are handled for level transitions:

Searched workspace
Looking for existing door slam and victory sound implementations
Let me also check the sound assets and IDs:

Searched workspace
Looking for sound asset definitions to understand available sounds
Now let me check the current game structure to understand how levels could be integrated:

Read file(s)

sound-config.ts
Now I have enough context to create the design document. Let me create it:

design.md


Does the design look good? If so, we can move on to the implementation plan.

Perfect! Now I'll create the implementation plan with specific coding tasks based on the design.

Created

tasks.md


Do the tasks look good?

Excellent! I've successfully created a comprehensive spec for the maze levels feature. The spec includes:

What We've Created
Requirements Document - Defined 5 key requirements covering:

Multi-level progression with proper sound effects
Unique maze characteristics for each level
Level-specific move limits
Extensible architecture for future levels
Persistent scoring across levels
Design Document - Outlined the technical architecture including:

MazeLevelManager for level coordination
Level data structures and interfaces
Integration with existing game systems
Comprehensive error handling strategy
Detailed testing approach
Implementation Plan - Created 12 specific coding tasks that will:

Build the core level management system
Create 5 distinct maze levels
Integrate with existing GameState and audio systems
Add proper UI updates for level information
Include comprehensive testing at all levels
Next Steps
The spec is now complete and ready for implementation. You can begin executing the tasks by:

Opening the tasks.md file at .kiro/specs/maze-levels/tasks.md
Clicking "Start task" next to any task item to begin implementation
Starting with task 1 to build the foundation, then progressing through the tasks in order
The implementation will transform your single-maze game into a multi-level experience with proper progression, sound effects, and scoring - exactly as specified in your requirements document.
