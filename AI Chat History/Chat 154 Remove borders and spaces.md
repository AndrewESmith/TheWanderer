I'll help you remove cell borders and gaps in your game. Let me first examine the current styling to understand how the cells are implemented.

Let me check the src folder structure to understand the game's styling approach:

Now let me check the CSS files to see the current styling:

App.css

index.css

maze.css
Perfect! I can see the issue. In the maze.css file, the .maze-grid has a gap: 2px property and each .cell has a border: 1px solid #333. Let me remove these to make the cells close together:

I also need to update the error state styling since it references borders:

Perfect! I've made the following changes to remove cell borders and gaps:

Removed grid gap: Changed gap: 2px to gap: 0 in .maze-grid
Removed cell borders: Changed border: 1px solid #333 to border: none in .cell
Removed border radius: Changed border-radius: 4px to border-radius: 0 for sharp edges
Updated error states: Replaced border with outline for image loading states to avoid affecting layout
The cells in your game will now be positioned directly next to each other with no gaps or borders, creating a seamless grid appearance. The outline properties for error/loading states won't affect the layout since they don't take up space like borders do.
