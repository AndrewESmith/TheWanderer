## Initial Problem
The user reported a failing test in the enhanced audio manager:

```
FAIL  src/tests/audio/enhanced-audio-manager.test.ts > Enhanced Audio Manager > WebAudioManager > enhanced preloading > should preload sounds with progress tracking
AssertionError: expected 0 to be greater than 0

```

## Analysis
I examined the test file and audio manager implementation to understand why `loadedCount` was 0 when it should be greater than 0.

### Root Cause Discovery
1. The test calls `manager.preloadSounds()` which calls the `AssetLoader.loadAssets()` method
2. However, the `WebAudioManager.preloadSounds()` method wasn't using `AssetLoader.loadAssets()` - it manually looped through `SOUND_ASSETS` and called `loadAudioBuffer()` for each one
3. The `AssetLoader.loadAssets()` method is the one that properly updates the `loadingState.loadedCount`, but it was never called
4. The `WebAudioManager.preloadSounds()` method didn't update the loading state properly

### Files Examined
- `src/tests/audio/enhanced-audio-manager.test.ts` - The failing test
- `src/audio/managers/audio-manager.ts` - The WebAudioManager implementation
- `src/audio/managers/asset-loader.ts` - The AssetLoader class that tracks loading state
- `src/audio/config/sound-config.ts` - Sound configuration with preload settings

## Solution Implementation

### Primary Fix
Modified the `WebAudioManager.preloadSounds()` method to use the `AssetLoader.loadAssets()` method:

```typescript
// Before: Manual loading without proper state tracking
const loadPromises = Object.entries(SOUND_ASSETS).map(async ([soundId, asset]) => {
    try {
        const buffer = await this.assetLoader.loadAudioBuffer(soundId, asset, this.state.audioContext!);
        if (buffer) {
            this.state.soundBuffers.set(soundId, buffer);
            this.state.loadedSounds.add(soundId);
        }
    } catch (error) {
        this.handleLoadError(soundId, error as Error);
    }
});

await Promise.allSettled(loadPromises);

// After: Using AssetLoader with proper state tracking and optimization
try {
    const buffers = await this.assetLoader.loadAssets(SOUND_ASSETS, this.state.audioContext);
    
    // Apply optimization to loaded buffers
    const optimizedBuffers = new Map<string, AudioBuffer>();
    buffers.forEach((buffer, soundId) => {
        try {
            // Apply basic optimization (normalization)
            const optimizedBuffer = this.optimizer.normalizeAudioBuffer(buffer);
            optimizedBuffers.set(soundId, optimizedBuffer);
            this.state.loadedSounds.add(soundId);
        } catch (optimizationError) {
            console.warn(`Failed to optimize ${soundId}, using original buffer:`, optimizationError);
            optimizedBuffers.set(soundId, buffer);
            this.state.loadedSounds.add(soundId);
        }
    });

    // Update our internal state with the optimized buffers
    this.state.soundBuffers = optimizedBuffers;

    console.log(`Preloaded ${this.state.loadedSounds.size} sounds`);
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Error during preloading:', error);
}
```

### Secondary Fix
The second failing test "should apply optimization during preloading" expected `mockAudioContext.createBuffer` to be called, but it wasn't being called. This was because optimization wasn't happening during preloading.

I added optimization during preloading by calling `this.optimizer.normalizeAudioBuffer(buffer)` for each loaded buffer, which internally calls `createBuffer` on the audio context.

## Key Changes Made

1. **Used AssetLoader.loadAssets()**: This method properly tracks loading state including `loadedCount`
2. **Added optimization during preloading**: Applied `AudioOptimizer.normalizeAudioBuffer()` to each loaded buffer
3. **Improved error handling**: Added fallback to original buffer if optimization fails
4. **Added fallback mode check**: Skip preloading if in fallback mode

## Test Results

### Before Fix
- ❌ "should preload sounds with progress tracking" - `loadedCount` was 0
- ❌ "should apply optimization during preloading" - `createBuffer` wasn't called

### After Fix
All 23 tests now pass:
- ✅ "should preload sounds with progress tracking" - Now properly tracks `loadedCount`
- ✅ "should apply optimization during preloading" - Now calls `createBuffer` during optimization
- ✅ All other existing tests continue to pass

## Summary
The fix successfully resolved the failing tests by ensuring that:
1. The audio manager properly tracks loading progress through the AssetLoader
2. Optimization is applied during preloading, which calls the expected audio context methods
3. All existing functionality remains intact and backward compatible

The solution maintains the existing API while adding the missing functionality that the tests were expecting.
