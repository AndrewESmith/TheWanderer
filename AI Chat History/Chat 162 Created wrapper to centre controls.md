The mobile controls ...

please refer to most...





The mobile controls have shifted left but they are still not directly below the maze. I would like the up and down arrows to appear below the maze centrered middled relative to the maze the right and left arrows remaining beside the down arrow as they are now.

I'll help you fix the mobile controls positioning to center them below the maze. Let me first examine the current code structure to understand how the controls are currently implemented.

Searched workspace
Searching for mobile control related code to understand current implementation
Now let me look at the current CSS for mobile controls to understand the positioning:

Read file(s)

maze.css 219 - 281
Now let me check the App.tsx to see how the mobile controls are structured in the JSX:

App.tsx 550 - 591
Let me also check the overall layout structure to understand where the maze is positioned:

Read file(s)

maze.css 1 - 51
Now let me check the main App component structure to see how everything is laid out:

App.tsx 500 - 561
Let me look at the beginning of the MazeGame component to understand the full structure:

App.tsx 430 - 471
Now I understand the structure. The mobile controls are currently positioned after the maze container and HUD. The issue is that they need to be centered relative to the maze width. Looking at the CSS, I can see that the mobile controls are trying to match the maze width using CSS custom properties, but they might not be perfectly aligned.

Let me check if there are any additional CSS rules that might be affecting the positioning:

Now I can see the issue. The mobile controls are using margin: 16px auto which should center them, but the width calculation might not be working correctly. Let me update the CSS to ensure the mobile controls are properly centered below the maze.

The key changes needed are:

Ensure the mobile controls container has the exact same width as the maze
Make sure the controls are properly centered within that width
Position them directly below the maze

Now let me also update the responsive styles to ensure proper centering on smaller screens:

Now let me also check if there are any container styles that might be affecting the overall layout. Let me look for the main container that wraps everything:

Read file(s)

App.tsx 460 - 501
I can see that the structure is:

Main div (no class)
AudioErrorDisplay and AudioDebug components
maze-container div with maze-grid inside
hud div
mobile-controls div (when showMobileControls is true)
The mobile controls should now be properly centered below the maze. However, let me also add some CSS to ensure the main container centers everything properly. Let me check if there's any CSS for the overall layout:

Looking for any body or main container CSS that might affect the overall layout
Let me check the index.css or any global styles:

Good, the body has margin: 0 which is what we want. Now let me add some CSS to ensure the main game container is centered and the mobile controls are properly positioned. Let me add a wrapper class to center everything:

I'll continue fixing the mobile controls positioning. Let me add the CSS for the game-wrapper class and ensure the mobile controls are properly centered below the maze.

Now let me also add CSS for the HUD to ensure it's centered as well:

Looking for existing HUD CSS to understand current styling
Let me search for HUD styles in a different way:

It seems the HUD styles might be inline or not defined yet. Let me add the HUD CSS to ensure it's properly centered and positioned:

Now let me also ensure the horizontal controls are properly centered:

Perfect! Now the mobile controls should be properly positioned:

Game wrapper: Centers all content vertically and horizontally on the page
Maze container: Centers the maze grid
HUD: Positioned with the same width as the maze and centered
Mobile controls:
Same width as the maze for perfect alignment
Up arrow centered above the horizontal controls
Left, down, and right arrows in a horizontal row below the up arrow
All controls centered relative to the maze width
The key improvements:

Added a game-wrapper class to center everything on the page
Mobile controls now use gap: 8px to properly space the up button from the horizontal controls
HUD is styled to match the maze width and be centered
All elements use the same --maze-width CSS custom property for consistent alignment
Responsive design ensures proper centering on smaller screens
The mobile controls should now appear directly below the maze, perfectly centered, with the up and down arrows positioned as requested.
