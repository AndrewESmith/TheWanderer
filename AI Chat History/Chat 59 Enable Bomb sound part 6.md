I can see the test is failing because it expects 3 calls to the victory sound but is getting 4. Let me examine the test file and the sound event mapper to understand what's happening.

Read file(s)

GameState-sound-integration.test.ts
Now let me check the sound event mapper to understand what sounds are being emitted:

Read file(s)

sound-event-mapper.ts
I can see the issue! Looking at the mapExitInteractionToSound function, it returns both a door_slam and a victory sound when the player exits. But the test is also expecting a delayed victory sound from the game end manager. This means we're getting:

Walk sound (from movement)
Door slam sound (from exit interaction)
Victory sound (from exit interaction) - This is the extra one
Victory sound (from game end manager after delay) - This is what the test expects
The problem is that the exit interaction is emitting a victory sound immediately, and then the game end manager is also emitting a victory sound after a delay. Let me check how the GameState handles this:

Now let me check the game end manager to see if it's also emitting victory sounds:

Now let me check where the delayed victory sound is coming from by looking at the GameState file:

GameState.ts
Now let me check the game end sound manager:

Searched workspace
Finding the game end sound manager file
Read file(s)

game-end-sound-manager.ts
Now I understand the issue! The problem is that:

The mapExitInteractionToSound function returns both door_slam and victory sounds immediately
The handleGameEndSounds function also emits a victory sound after a 50ms delay
The test expects only 3 calls total: walk, door_slam, and the delayed victory sound
The issue is that the exit interaction is emitting a victory sound immediately, but the game end manager is also emitting one after a delay. This creates a duplicate victory sound.

Looking at the code in GameState.ts, I can see that when the game ends, it filters out game-state-change sounds (death and victory) from the player sound events and lets the game end manager handle them. However, the exit interaction sounds are still being emitted.

The fix is to remove the victory sound from the mapExitInteractionToSound function since the game end manager should handle all victory sounds:

Now I need to update the test that expects the exit interaction to return both door slam and victory sounds, since we've changed it to only return the door slam:

I see there are still issues. Let me examine what's happening more closely. The victory test is still getting 4 calls instead of 3, and there's also an issue with the bomb test. Let me check what sounds are actually being emitted by adding some debugging:

Great! The victory test is now passing. The debug output shows exactly what we expected:

player_walk (movement sound)
door_slam (exit interaction sound)
victory_sound (delayed victory sound from game end manager)
Now let me remove the debug code and fix the bomb test. Let me first check what's happening with the bomb test:

Accepted edits to

GameState-sound-integration.test.ts


Now let me check the bomb test. The error shows that it's expecting a player_walk sound but getting a bomb_sound instead. Looking at the sound event mapper, when a player moves to a bomb cell, it should emit a bomb explosion sound, not a walk sound. Let me check what the test expects vs what should actually happen:

Read file(s)

GameState-sound-integration.test.ts 85 - 126
I see the issue. The test expects a player_walk sound when hitting a bomb, but according to the sound event mapper, when a player moves to a bomb cell, it should emit a bomb_explode sound, not a walk sound.

Looking at the mapPlayerMovementToSound function:

// Player hitting bomb should play bomb explosion sound
if (toCell === CELL.BOMB) {
    return {
        type: 'bomb_explode',
        source: 'player',
        priority: 'high',
        volume: 0.9
    };
}
The test is incorrect. When a player hits a bomb, it should emit a bomb explosion sound, not a walk sound. Let me fix the test:

I need to fix the sound event integration test as well. It's expecting 4 events when the player wins, but now that I removed the victory sound from the exit interaction, it should only expect 3 events. Let me check and fix this test:

Read file(s)

sound-event-integration.test.ts 330 - 371
I can see the issue. The test expects 4 events including two victory sounds (one from exit interaction and one from game state change), but now that I removed the victory sound from exit interaction, it should only expect 3 events: movement, door slam, and victory (from game state change).

Perfect! All tests are now passing and there are no more warnings about unused variables.

Summary
I successfully fixed the failing test by identifying and resolving the root cause of the issue:

Problem: The test was expecting 3 calls to the victory sound but was getting 4 calls because:

The mapExitInteractionToSound function was emitting a victory sound immediately when the player exits
The handleGameEndSounds function was also emitting a victory sound after a 50ms delay
This created a duplicate victory sound
Solution:

Removed the victory sound from mapExitInteractionToSound - The exit interaction should only emit a door slam sound, not a victory sound. Victory sounds should be handled exclusively by the game end manager to avoid duplication.

Updated the corresponding test - Changed the mapExitInteractionToSound test to expect only a door slam sound instead of both door slam and victory sounds.

Fixed the bomb test - The test was incorrectly expecting a walk sound when hitting a bomb, but the sound mapper correctly emits a bomb explosion sound. Updated the test to expect the correct bomb sound.

Updated the generatePlayerMoveEvents test - Adjusted the expected number of events from 4 to 3 since we removed the duplicate victory sound.

Cleaned up unused variables - Removed the unused newState variables to eliminate warnings.

Key Changes:

src/audio/events/sound-event-mapper.ts: Removed victory sound from exit interaction
src/tests/sound-event-integration.test.ts: Updated tests to match the new behavior
src/tests/GameState-sound-integration.test.ts: Fixed bomb test expectations and cleaned up unused variables
The fix ensures that victory sounds are only emitted once by the game end manager, maintaining the intended audio behavior while making the tests pass correctly.
