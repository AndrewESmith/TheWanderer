## Analysis

I can see there's a failing test in the audio manager. The test expects `isSupported()` to return `false` when audio context creation fails, but it's returning `true`. Let me examine the test file and the WebAudioManager implementation to understand what's happening.

I read the test file to understand the failing test case and its context. The test is mocking the AudioContext constructor to throw an error and expects `isSupported()` to return `false`.

I found the WebAudioManager class implementation and examined how `isSupported()` works. The current implementation only checks if the AudioContext constructor exists:

```typescript
isSupported(): boolean {
    return !!(window.AudioContext || (window as any).webkitAudioContext);
}
```

But the test is mocking the AudioContext constructor to throw an error, and the `isSupported()` method should return `false` when AudioContext creation fails. The method should check if the AudioContext can actually be created, not just if the constructor exists.

Looking at the constructor, I can see that when AudioContext creation fails, it sets `this.errorHandling.fallbackMode = true` and `this.state.isInitialized = false`. The `isSupported()` method should check these states.

## The Fix

I fixed the `isSupported()` method:

```typescript
/**
 * Check if Web Audio API is supported and initialized
 */
isSupported(): boolean {
    return this.state.isInitialized && !this.errorHandling.fallbackMode;
}
```

Now let's run the specific failing test to see if it passes.

The test is now passing! Let's run all the audio manager tests to make sure we didn't break anything else.

Excellent! The main issue is fixed. The test "should handle audio context creation failure" is now passing. There's one remaining test failure, but it's unrelated to the original issue. The failing test is expecting a different error message format.

I checked that specific test to understand what it's expecting. The test is expecting the old error message format. Let me look at the current `playSound` method to see how it handles errors.

Perfect! I can see that the `playSound` method now uses `this.handlePlayError(soundId, error as Error)` instead of directly logging to console. The test needs to be updated to expect the new error message format. Let me update the test:

```typescript
// Verify that error was logged
expect(consoleErrorSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith('Play error for test_sound:', expect.any(Error));
```

Now let's run the specific failing test to see if it passes.

Perfect! Now let's run all the audio manager tests to make sure everything is working.

Perfect! All tests are now passing. Let me summarize what was fixed:

## Summary

I successfully fixed the failing test by updating the `isSupported()` method in the `WebAudioManager` class. Here's what was done:

### The Problem
The test "should handle audio context creation failure" was failing because:
- The test mocked the `AudioContext` constructor to throw an error
- The test expected `isSupported()` to return `false` when AudioContext creation fails
- However, the original `isSupported()` method only checked if the AudioContext constructor existed, not whether it could actually be created successfully

### The Solution
I updated the `isSupported()` method in `src/audio/managers/audio-manager.ts`:

**Before:**
```typescript
isSupported(): boolean {
    return !!(window.AudioContext || (window as any).webkitAudioContext);
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
isSupported(): boolean {
    return this.state.isInitialized && !this.errorHandling.fallbackMode;
}
```

### Why This Works
- When the AudioContext constructor throws an error during initialization, the `initializeAudioContext()` method catches it and calls `handleAudioContextError()`
- This method sets `this.errorHandling.fallbackMode = true` and `this.state.isInitialized = false`
- The updated `isSupported()` method now correctly returns `false` when either the audio context failed to initialize or the manager is in fallback mode

### Additional Fix
I also updated one test expectation that was checking for an old error message format:
- Changed from expecting "Failed to create audio source:" to "Play error for test_sound:" to match the current error handling implementation

### Result
All 27 audio manager tests now pass, including the previously failing test "should handle audio context creation failure".
