  (gameState.player.x !== previousPlayerPos?.x ||
    gameState.player.y !== previousPlayerPos?.y)
) {
  setPlayerPosition({ ...gameState.player });
}
How do I fix the following problem in the above code?: This expression is not callable.
  Type 'IPlayerPos' has no call signatures.

Looking at the error, the issue is on line 354 where you're trying to call setPlayerPosition as a function, but it's declared as a state value instead of a setter function.

The problem is in this line:

const [setPlayerPosition] = React.useState(
  () => gameState.player || { x: 0, y: 0 }
);
You're destructuring only the first element (the state value) and naming it setPlayerPosition, but you're trying to use it as a setter function later.

Here's the fix:

The fix changes the destructuring to properly get both the state value (playerPosition) and the setter function (setPlayerPosition). This way, when you call setPlayerPosition({ ...gameState.player }) later in the code, you're actually calling the setter function instead of trying to call the state value as a function.


App.tsx 324 - 330



  (gameState.player.x !== previousPlayerPos?.x ||
    gameState.player.y !== previousPlayerPos?.y)
) {
  setPlayerPosition({ ...gameState.player });

I see the issue is still there. The autofix didn't complete the fix properly. Looking at line 170, you still have the incorrect destructuring:

const [setPlayerPosition] = React.useState(
  () => gameState.player || { x: 0, y: 0 }
);
You're only getting the state value but naming it setPlayerPosition, then trying to call it as a function. Let me fix this:

Now the code properly destructures the useState hook to get both the state value (playerPosition) and the setter function (setPlayerPosition), which allows you to call setPlayerPosition({ ...gameState.player }) without the "not callable" error.

// Track player position separately to avoid maze re-renders
const [playerPosition, setPlayerPosition] = React.useState(
  () => gameState.player || { x: 0, y: 0 }
);
How do I fix the following problem in the above code?: 'playerPosition' is declared but its value is never read.

The warning is correct - playerPosition is declared but never used. Looking at the code and comments, it seems this state was kept for potential future use but isn't actually needed since the Cell component uses the maze data directly for rendering.

Since the comment says "This is kept for potential future use but the Cell component should NOT depend on this state for rendering the player", and it's not being used anywhere, we can remove it to clean up the code:

Now we also need to remove the setPlayerPosition call in the movePlayer function since it's no longer needed:

App.tsx


Perfect! Now the code is cleaner and doesn't have any unused variables. The player movement still works correctly because:

The gameState.movePlayer(dx, dy) call updates the game state
The setStableMazeRef call immediately updates the maze reference that the Cell components use for rendering
The Cell components render the player based on the maze data directly (using the type prop)
This approach is actually better because it eliminates the potential for synchronization issues between separate player position state and the actual maze data.


App.tsx 303 - 309


const movePlayer = React.useCallback(
  (dx: number, dy: number) => {
    // Store the previous state for comparison
    const previousPlayerPos = gameState.player;

    // Stop all currently playing sounds before the player moves
How do I fix the following problem in the above code?: 'previousPlayerPos' is declared but its value is never read.

You're right - previousPlayerPos is declared but never used since we removed the player position tracking code. Let's clean this up by removing the unused variable:

App.tsx


Perfect! Now the code is clean and doesn't have any unused variables. The movePlayer function is now more streamlined and focuses on the essential operations:

Stop all sounds
Move the player in the game state
Update the stable maze reference for immediate visual updates
Force a re-render for any other state changes
This maintains the same functionality while eliminating the unused variable warning.
