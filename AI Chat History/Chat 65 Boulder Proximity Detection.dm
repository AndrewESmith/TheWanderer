I'll implement task 2: "Implement proximity detection system" from the boulder behavior refinement spec. Let me start by updating the task status and then examining the current codebase to understand the existing structure.

Task: 2. Implement proximity detection system from 
tasks.md
Status: In Progress
Now let me examine the existing codebase to understand the current structure and types:

Read file(s)

GameState.ts

maze.ts

PlayerPos.ts
Now let me check the interfaces to understand the position types:

Read file(s)

IPlayerPos.ts

IGameState.ts
Now let me check if there are any existing physics or boulder-related files:

Searched workspace
Checking the physics directory structure
Let me examine the existing boulder state manager and physics engine:

Read file(s)

boulder-state-manager.ts

physics-engine.ts

collision-detection.ts
Now let me check the tests directory to understand the testing structure:

Let me check the existing boulder state manager test to understand the testing patterns:

Read file(s)

boulder-state-manager.test.ts
Perfect! I can see that the boulder state manager already has comprehensive proximity detection functionality implemented. Looking at the existing code and tests, I can see that task 2 is actually already implemented. Let me verify what specific functionality is covered:

✅ Create functions to detect when player is adjacent to boulders - detectAdjacentBoulders function exists
✅ Implement logic to identify newly triggered boulders based on player movement - identifyTriggeredBoulders function exists
✅ Add validation for proximity detection edge cases (boundaries, corners) - Covered in the tests
✅ Write unit tests for proximity detection algorithms - Comprehensive tests exist
Let me run the existing tests to confirm they pass:

Excellent! All 35 tests pass. Now let me examine the specific proximity detection functions to verify they meet all the requirements:

Searched workspace
Examining the specific proximity detection functions to verify they meet requirements
Let me also check if there are any edge case validations for boundaries and corners in the tests:

Searched workspace
Looking for boundary and corner edge case tests in the boulder state manager tests
Let me check if there are any additional edge case tests that might be needed for boundaries:

Searched workspace
Looking for any boundary or edge case handling in the proximity detection functions
Now let me check if there are any specific boundary tests that should be added. Let me look at the requirements again and see if there are any gaps:

Read file(s)

requirements.md 15 - 26
Let me check requirement 1.5 specifically:

Searched workspace
Looking for requirement 1.5 in the requirements document
Let me read the full requirements to understand what 1.5 refers to:

Read file(s)

requirements.md
I see that the requirements are numbered 1.1, 1.2, etc. within each requirement section. The task mentions "Requirements: 1.1, 1.5" but I only see requirements 1.1-1.5 under Requirement 1. Let me check if there are any missing edge case tests that should be added for boundary conditions.

Looking at the existing implementation and tests, I can see that the proximity detection system is already comprehensive. However, let me add some additional edge case tests for boundary conditions to ensure complete coverage:

Perfect! All 40 tests pass, including the new edge case tests I added. Now let me verify that the implementation meets all the task requirements by checking each sub-task:

Task 2 Verification: "Implement proximity detection system"
✅ Sub-task 1: "Create functions to detect when player is adjacent to boulders"
Function: detectAdjacentBoulders(playerPosition: Position, boulderPositions: Position[]): Position[]
Implementation: Uses arePositionsAdjacent to check if player is within 1 cell (including diagonals) of each boulder
Tests: Comprehensive tests including boundary cases, all 8 adjacent positions, and negative coordinates
✅ Sub-task 2: "Implement logic to identify newly triggered boulders based on player movement"
Function: identifyTriggeredBoulders(previousPlayerPosition: Position | null, currentPlayerPosition: Position, boulderStateManager: BoulderStateManager): Position[]
Implementation: Compares current adjacent boulders with previous adjacent boulders to find newly triggered ones
Tests: Tests for player movement scenarios, boundary edge cases, and maze boundary crossings
✅ Sub-task 3: "Add validation for proximity detection edge cases (boundaries, corners)"
Edge Cases Covered:
Player at maze corners (0,0)
All 8 adjacent positions around a center point
Negative coordinates handling
Boundary edge cases for triggered boulder identification
Player movement across maze boundaries
Tests: Added comprehensive edge case tests that all pass
✅ Sub-task 4: "Write unit tests for proximity detection algorithms"
Test Coverage: 40 comprehensive tests covering:
Position utilities (key creation/parsing)
Boulder position detection in maze
Position adjacency detection (orthogonal, diagonal, non-adjacent)
Adjacent boulder detection with edge cases
Triggered boulder identification with movement scenarios
All other boulder state management functions
Test Results: All tests pass
✅ Requirements Verification:
Requirement 1.1: ✅ "WHEN a player moves into a cell adjacent to a boulder THEN the system SHALL mark that boulder as 'triggered'" - Implemented via identifyTriggeredBoulders and updateBoulderTriggers
Requirement 1.5: ✅ "IF a boulder is not adjacent to a player THEN the boulder SHALL remain stationary" - Implemented via adjacency detection logic
The proximity detection system is fully implemented and thoroughly tested. All functions are pure functions following TypeScript standards, with comprehensive edge case handling and validation.

Task: 2. Implement proximity detection system from 
tasks.md
Status: Completed
Task 2 "Implement proximity detection system" has been completed successfully!

Summary
The proximity detection system was already implemented in the boulder state manager, but I enhanced it with additional edge case tests to ensure comprehensive coverage. The implementation includes:

Core Functions:

arePositionsAdjacent() - Checks if two positions are within 1 cell (including diagonals)
detectAdjacentBoulders() - Finds all boulders adjacent to player position
identifyTriggeredBoulders() - Identifies newly triggered boulders based on player movement
Edge Case Coverage:

Boundary conditions (corners, edges)
All 8 adjacent positions
Negative coordinates
Player movement across maze boundaries
Empty maze scenarios
Test Coverage:

40 comprehensive unit tests
All tests pass
Covers normal cases, edge cases, and error conditions
The system meets all requirements (1.1 and 1.5) and follows TypeScript best practices with pure functions and immutable data structures.
