I'll implement task 1 from the how-to-play-popup spec, which involves creating TypeScript interfaces and types. Let me start by updating the task status and then creating the necessary type definitions.

Task: 1. Create TypeScript interfaces and types from 
tasks.md
Status: In Progress
Now let me examine the existing project structure to understand where to place the type definitions and what patterns are already established.

Searched workspace
Examining the src directory structure to understand existing patterns for type definitions
I can see the project has an established pattern with a dedicated src/Interfaces directory for type definitions. Let me examine the existing interfaces to understand the naming conventions and patterns.

Read file(s)

index.ts

IGameState.ts

IAudioManager.ts
Now let me check the requirements and design documents to understand exactly what interfaces I need to create:

Read file(s)

requirements.md
Read file(s)

design.md
Now I have a clear understanding of what interfaces need to be created. Based on the design document and requirements, I need to create TypeScript interfaces for:

HowToPlayPopupProps
HowToPlayContentProps
HowToPlaySettings
UseHowToPlaySettingsReturn
StoredHowToPlaySettings
GameInstruction
CreditsSection
Let me create the interface file following the project's naming convention:

Created

IHowToPlayPopup.ts


Now I need to update the main interfaces index file to export the new interfaces:

Accepted edits to

index.ts


Let me verify that the interfaces are properly structured and follow TypeScript best practices by running a quick type check:

Command
npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck src/Interfaces/IHowToPlayPopup.ts
npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck src/Interfaces/IHowToPlayPopup.ts
Great! No TypeScript errors. Let me also verify that the interfaces can be imported correctly:

Command
npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck src/Interfaces/index.ts
npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck src/Interfaces/index.ts
Perfect! Now let me verify that all the required interfaces from the task details have been created by checking against the requirements:

✅ HowToPlayPopupProps - Created with isOpen, onClose, and optional triggeredFromSettings
✅ HowToPlaySettings - Created with dontShowAgain and hasSeenInstructions
✅ Related interfaces - Created additional interfaces as specified in design:
HowToPlayContentProps for content component
UseHowToPlaySettingsReturn for settings hook
StoredHowToPlaySettings for localStorage schema
GameInstruction for instruction content structure
CreditsSection for credits data
GameInstructionsData for complete instruction data
Let me also verify that the interfaces align with the requirements mentioned in the task:

Requirements 1.1, 4.1, 5.1 coverage:

✅ Requirement 1.1 (popup display): HowToPlayPopupProps with isOpen and onClose
✅ Requirement 4.1 (game instructions): GameInstruction and GameInstructionsData interfaces
✅ Requirement 5.1 (credits): CreditsSection interface with author, links, and acknowledgements
Let me run a final check to ensure the project still compiles correctly:

Command
npm run build
npm run build
Excellent! The build completed successfully. Now let me mark the task as complete:

Task: 1. Create TypeScript interfaces and types from 
tasks.md
Status: Completed
Task 1 Complete ✅
I have successfully implemented task 1 by creating comprehensive TypeScript interfaces and types for the How to Play popup feature. Here's what was accomplished:

Created Interfaces:
HowToPlayPopupProps - Main popup component props with isOpen, onClose, and optional triggeredFromSettings
HowToPlayContentProps - Content component props with optional className
HowToPlaySettings - Settings state with dontShowAgain and hasSeenInstructions
UseHowToPlaySettingsReturn - Hook return type with settings management methods
StoredHowToPlaySettings - localStorage schema with version tracking
GameInstruction - Individual instruction structure with title, content, and type
CreditsSection - Credits data structure with author, links, and acknowledgements
GameInstructionsData - Complete instruction data combining instructions and credits
Key Features:
✅ Follows project's TypeScript conventions using interfaces over types
✅ Comprehensive JSDoc documentation for all interfaces
✅ Proper export structure through the main interfaces index
✅ Covers all requirements (1.1, 4.1, 5.1) specified in the task
✅ Includes future-proofing with version tracking for content updates
✅ TypeScript compilation verified with no errors
The interfaces are now ready to be used in the subsequent tasks for implementing the settings hook, components, and integration logic.
