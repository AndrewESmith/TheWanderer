I can see there's a failing test in the boulder state manager. Let me examine the test file and the related code to understand what's happening.

Read file(s)

boulder-state-manager.test.ts 450 - 471
Let me see more context around this test to understand the setup:

Now let me check the boulder state manager implementation to see what might be wrong with the getTriggeredBouldersForMove function:

I found the issue! Looking at the getTriggeredBouldersForMove function, there's a logic error. The test expects that boulders triggered on move 5 should be returned when checking for move 6, but the current implementation has the condition backwards.

The test shows:

Boulders are triggered on move 5
When checking for move 6, it expects those boulders to be returned
But the current logic checks if state.triggeredOnMove === currentMoveNumber + 1
For move 6, this would check if triggeredOnMove === 7, but the boulders were triggered on move 5.

The logic should be that boulders triggered on move N should start moving on move N+1. So for move 6, we should return boulders that were triggered on move 5.

Let me fix this:

Now let's run the specific failing test to see if this fixes it:

Perfect! All 40 tests in the boulder state manager are now passing. The fix was simple but crucial - the logic for determining when triggered boulders should start moving was inverted.

The corrected logic now properly implements the intended behavior:

Boulders triggered on move N should start moving on move N+1
So when checking for move 6, we look for boulders that were triggered on move 5 (currentMoveNumber - 1)
The test failure has been resolved and all boulder state manager tests are passing.
