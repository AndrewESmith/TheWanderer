I can see you have a failing test in the audio error handling module. The test is expecting an event listener to be added for 'click' events, but it's not being called. Let me examine the test file and the related audio code to understand what's happening.

Read file(s)

error-handling.test.ts
Now let me look at the WebAudioManager implementation to understand how it handles suspended audio contexts:

Read file(s)

audio-manager.ts
The file is truncated. Let me look at the specific part that handles audio context suspension:

Searched workspace
Looking for the handleAudioContextSuspension method to understand how event listeners are added
Now let me see the full implementation of the handleAudioContextSuspension method:

Read file(s)

audio-manager.ts 283 - 351
Now I understand the issue! The test is expecting the event listeners to be added during the WebAudioManager constructor, but the handleAudioContextSuspension method is only called when the audio context is actually suspended. However, in the test, the mock audio context is set to 'suspended' state, but the WebAudioManager constructor calls initializeAudioContext() which only calls handleAudioContextSuspension() if the context is successfully created.

Let me look at the failing test more closely:

Read file(s)

error-handling.test.ts 150 - 181
The issue is that the test is expecting the event listeners to be added immediately when the WebAudioManager is created, but it's not actually creating the WebAudioManager instance in the test. Let me see the full test:

Read file(s)

error-handling.test.ts 140 - 186
I can see the issue now! The test is missing the actual creation of the WebAudioManager instance. The test sets up the mock, spies on document.addEventListener, but never actually creates a WebAudioManager instance that would trigger the event listener setup. Let me fix this:

Perfect! All tests in the error-handling test file are now passing. The issue was that the test was expecting event listeners to be added when a WebAudioManager is created with a suspended audio context, but the test wasn't actually creating the WebAudioManager instance.

The fix was simple: I added const manager = new WebAudioManager(); to the test to actually instantiate the manager, which triggers the initializeAudioContext() method, which in turn calls handleAudioContextSuspension() when the audio context is in a suspended state, and that's what adds the event listeners that the test was expecting.

The test now properly:

Sets up a mock suspended audio context
Creates a WebAudioManager instance (which triggers the suspension handling)
Verifies that event listeners were added for user interaction events
Simulates a click event to test the resume functionality
Verifies that the audio context resume method was called
This fix ensures that the audio error handling and fallback mechanisms work correctly when dealing with browser autoplay policies that suspend audio contexts until user interaction occurs.
