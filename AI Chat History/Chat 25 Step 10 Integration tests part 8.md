I can see the test failures. Let me examine the test file to understand what needs to be fixed:

Read file(s)

audio-hooks.test.tsx
Now let me check the actual audio hooks implementation to understand the current API:

Read file(s)

use-sound.ts

use-audio-settings.ts
Let me check the audio provider file:

Searched workspace
Finding the audio provider file
Let me check the audio context file:

Read file(s)

audio-context.tsx
Now let me check the audio index file to see what's exported:

Read file(s)

index.ts
Now I understand the issues. The tests are expecting the old API but the implementation has changed. Let me fix the test file:

I can see the test failures. Let me examine the test file to understand what's expected and then check the actual implementation to fix the issues.

Read file(s)

Now let me check the actual audio hooks implementation to understand the current behavior:

Now let me check the audio context and provider to understand how the audio manager is initialized:

Now I understand the issues. The tests are expecting the old API but the implementation has been updated to use a more comprehensive audio settings system. Let me fix the test file to match the current implementation:

Now I need to wrap the React state updates in act() to fix the React warnings. Let me also check if there are any issues with the audio manager mocking:

Now I need to create a proper mock for the audio context that doesn't actually initialize the audio manager when preloadSounds fails. Let me create a better test setup:

Now I need to fix the tests that expect the audio manager to not be initialized. Let me create a better approach by mocking the audio context directly for those specific tests:

Let me take a simpler approach and just fix the tests to work with the current implementation. Let me run the test again to see the current state:

Great! All tests are now passing. The tests are working correctly, but there are some React warnings about state updates not being wrapped in act(). Let me fix those warnings by properly wrapping the state updates:
