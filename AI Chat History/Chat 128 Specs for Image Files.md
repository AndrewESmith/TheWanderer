I want to change the graphics system so that it uses image files rather than icons. For details please refer to the file #Upgrade Graphics.md

I'll help you create a spec for upgrading the graphics system from emoji icons to PNG image files. Let me first check if there's already a spec for this feature and examine the current implementation.

Checking the public folder to confirm the PNG files are available
Perfect! I can see that all the required PNG files are already in the public folder. Now I'll create a new spec for the graphics upgrade feature. Based on the requirements, this is a clear feature that needs its own specification.

Do the requirements look good? If so, we can move on to the design.

Great! Now I'll create the design document for the graphics upgrade feature. Let me examine the current rendering system to understand how the graphics are currently displayed.

Now I have a good understanding of the current system. Let me create the design document.

Does the design look good? If so, we can move on to the implementation plan.

Perfect! Now I'll create the implementation plan with actionable coding tasks based on the requirements and design.

tasks.md


Do the tasks look good?

Excellent! The graphics upgrade spec is now complete with comprehensive requirements, design, and implementation tasks.

Summary
I've created a complete specification for upgrading the maze game graphics from emoji icons to PNG images:

ðŸ“‹ Requirements: 5 user stories covering visual consistency, performance, maintainability, error handling, and build system integration

ðŸŽ¨ Design: Detailed architecture preserving the existing system while switching from emoji to PNG rendering, including error handling and asset management strategies

âœ… Tasks: 10 actionable implementation tasks covering code changes, testing, performance validation, and build integration

The spec is ready for implementation! You can now start executing tasks by opening the tasks.md file and clicking "Start task" next to any task item. I recommend starting with task 1 (updating the ICONS constant) as it's the foundation for all other changes.

The design maintains backward compatibility and includes robust error handling to ensure the game remains playable even if images fail to load. All existing functionality including responsive design, mobile controls, and game logic will be preserved.
