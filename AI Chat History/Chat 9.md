Create a task to upgrade to Vite

Kiro
I see you're working on a task that's optimized for spec sessions. Would you like to start a dedicated spec session for the best experience?

Yes

I'll help you create a spec for upgrading your project from React Scripts to Vite. Let's start by creating a new feature spec for this task.

Error(s) while searching workspace
Checking if the specs directory exists and what specs are already there
Let's create the necessary directory structure for the spec:

Command
mkdir -p .kiro/specs/vite-migration
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.22621.4317]
(c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

D:\FizzBash\TheWanderer>



















mkdir -p .kiro/specs/vite-migration
The syntax of the command is incorrect.D:\FizzBash\TheWanderer
Adding a command to the trust list allows me to auto run this command in the future without asking for your approval every time. Manage the command trust list in the Trusted Commands setting. Which variation would you like to add?


Full command
mkdir -p .kiro/specs/vite-migration

Base
mkdir *
Let me try with the correct Windows command:

Now let's create the requirements document for the Vite migration:

Created

requirements.md


Now, let's create the design document:

Created

design.md


Now, let's create the tasks document:

Created

tasks.md


Do the requirements look good? If so, we can move on to the design.

Does the design look good? If so, we can move on to the implementation plan.

Do the tasks look good?

I've created a complete spec for migrating your project from React Scripts to Vite. The spec includes:

Requirements Document - Outlines the goals and acceptance criteria for the migration
Design Document - Details the architectural changes and migration strategy
Tasks Document - Provides a step-by-step implementation plan with specific coding tasks
The migration will help resolve the Jest/Vitest conflicts you've been experiencing while also providing a faster development experience with Vite.

To start implementing this migration, you can open the tasks.md file and click "Start task" next to any task item. I recommend starting with task 1 (Set up Vite and remove React Scripts) and proceeding in the order listed.

The tasks are organized in a logical sequence to ensure a smooth migration:

First, set up the basic Vite infrastructure
Then configure the build system and development server
Update CSS processing and import paths
Configure VS Code integration
Test and verify everything works
Update documentation
Would you like me to help you start implementing any of these tasks now?
