# Creating a Vite Migration Spec

## Initial Request

Create a task to upgrade to Vite

## Starting the Spec Session

I see you're working on a task that's optimized for spec sessions. Would you like to start a dedicated spec session for the best experience?

Yes

I'll help you create a spec for upgrading your project from React Scripts to Vite. Let's start by creating a new feature spec for this task.

## Creating Directory Structure

Let's create the necessary directory structure for the spec:

```
mkdir .kiro\specs\vite-migration
```

## Creating Specification Documents

Now let's create the requirements document for the Vite migration:
- Created `requirements.md`

Now, let's create the design document:
- Created `design.md`

Now, let's create the tasks document:
- Created `tasks.md`

## Spec Overview

I've created a complete spec for migrating your project from React Scripts to Vite. The spec includes:

- **Requirements Document** - Outlines the goals and acceptance criteria for the migration
- **Design Document** - Details the architectural changes and migration strategy
- **Tasks Document** - Provides a step-by-step implementation plan with specific coding tasks

The migration will help resolve the Jest/Vitest conflicts you've been experiencing while also providing a faster development experience with Vite.

## Implementation Plan

To start implementing this migration, you can open the tasks.md file and click "Start task" next to any task item. I recommend starting with task 1 (Set up Vite and remove React Scripts) and proceeding in the order listed.

The tasks are organized in a logical sequence to ensure a smooth migration:

1. First, set up the basic Vite infrastructure
2. Then configure the build system and development server
3. Update CSS processing and import paths
4. Configure VS Code integration
5. Test and verify everything works
6. Update documentation

Would you like me to help you start implementing any of these tasks now?
