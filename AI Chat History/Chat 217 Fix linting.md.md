// Helper function to handle browser-specific popup visibility issues
async function handlePopupVisibility(page: any, popup: any, shouldBeVisible: boolean = false) {
    const browserName = await page.evaluate(() => navigator.userAgent);
    const isWebKit = browserName.includes('WebKit');
How do I fix the following problem in the above code?: 'handlePopupVisibility' is declared but its value is never read.

The issue is that you have a handlePopupVisibility helper function declared at the top of the file, but it's never actually used anywhere in the test code. You have two options to fix this:

Option 1: Remove the unused function (Recommended)
Since the function isn't being used, simply remove it:

This is the cleanest solution since the function was never used and the tests are already handling popup visibility inline with their own browser-specific logic.

Option 2: Use the function (Alternative)
If you wanted to keep and use the function, you'd need to replace the inline popup handling code throughout your tests with calls to handlePopupVisibility(). However, looking at your test code, each test case has its own specific popup handling logic that's more detailed than what the helper function provides, so removing it is the better approach.

The warning should now be resolved!
