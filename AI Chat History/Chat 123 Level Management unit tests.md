I'll implement task 8 to create comprehensive unit tests for level management. Let me start by updating the task status and then examining the existing code structure to understand what needs to be tested.

Task: 8. Create comprehensive unit tests for level management from 
tasks.md
Status: In Progress
Let me examine the existing level management code to understand what needs to be tested:

Searched workspace
Finding the MazeLevelManager implementation to understand its structure for testing
Read file(s)

IMazeLevelManager.ts
Searched workspace
Finding the actual MazeLevelManager implementation
Searched workspace
Searching for MazeLevelManager implementation in the codebase
Searched workspace
Checking the levels directory structure to understand the implementation
Read file(s)

maze-level-manager.ts

level-progression-handler.ts
Now let me check the existing test structure to understand the testing patterns:

Searched workspace
Checking the test directory structure to understand existing test patterns
I can see there are already some level-related tests. Let me check the existing tests to understand what's already covered:

Read file(s)

maze-level-manager.test.ts

level-progression-handler.test.ts

gamestate-level-integration.test.ts
Now let me check the GameState interface to understand the integration:

Read file(s)

GameState.ts
Now let me check what interfaces are needed for the tests:

Read file(s)

IMazeLevelData.ts

ILevelProgressionResult.ts

IGameState.ts
Now I have a good understanding of the existing test coverage. I can see that there are already comprehensive tests for:

MazeLevelManager - basic functionality, navigation, validation
LevelProgressionHandler - level completion logic and sound events
GameState integration - basic level integration
However, looking at the task requirements, I need to create more comprehensive tests that cover:

Score persistence and move limit resets
More thorough GameState integration with level management
Additional validation scenarios
Let me create comprehensive unit tests that expand on the existing coverage:

Created

level-management-comprehensive.test.ts


Now let me run the tests to ensure they pass and provide comprehensive coverage:

I need to fix the test that's failing. The issue is with the score persistence test - let me examine the maze setup more carefully and fix the test:

Let me check the exact content around that test:

Now I can fix the test. The issue is that the player is not actually moving to collect the diamond. Let me fix this:

Great! All tests are passing. Now let me update the task status to complete and provide a summary of what I've implemented:

Task: 8. Create comprehensive unit tests for level management from 
tasks.md
Status: Completed
Task 8 Complete: Comprehensive Unit Tests for Level Management
I have successfully implemented comprehensive unit tests for level management that cover all the requirements specified in the task. Here's what I accomplished:

✅ Test Coverage Implemented
1. MazeLevelManager Level Navigation and Validation

✅ Validates all level configurations on initialization
✅ Tests level navigation (getCurrentLevel, hasNextLevel, advanceToNextLevel)
✅ Validates maze dimensions (16x10) across all levels
✅ Verifies element counts match actual maze content (diamonds, bombs, exits, players)
✅ Tests edge cases (advancing beyond last level)
✅ Validates position constraints and data integrity
2. Level Progression Logic and Sound Event Generation

✅ Tests sound event generation for level transitions (door_slam vs victory)
✅ Validates level completion detection logic
✅ Tests progression through all levels with correct results
✅ Verifies integration with sound event emitter
3. GameState Integration with Level Management

✅ Tests initialization with correct level 1 data
✅ Validates level manager state consistency
✅ Tests level progression handler integration
✅ Verifies proper integration of all level management components
4. Score Persistence and Move Limit Resets

✅ Tests score persistence across level transitions
✅ Validates move limit resets for each new level
✅ Tests diamond count resets for each new level
✅ Verifies cumulative scoring across multiple level transitions
5. Error Handling and Edge Cases

✅ Tests invalid level manager states
✅ Validates level data integrity
✅ Tests progression handler edge cases
✅ Comprehensive validation of all level properties and types
6. Performance and Memory Management

✅ Tests for memory leaks during level transitions
✅ Performance testing for rapid level manager operations
📋 Requirements Satisfied
Requirement 1.1: ✅ Level navigation and management tested
Requirement 1.2: ✅ Level progression logic tested
Requirement 1.3: ✅ Sound event generation tested
Requirement 3.3: ✅ Move limit resets tested
Requirement 5.1: ✅ Score persistence tested
Requirement 5.2: ✅ Cumulative scoring tested
🧪 Test Results
19 comprehensive tests created in level-management-comprehensive.test.ts
All tests passing ✅
Existing tests still passing ✅ (verified maze-level-manager.test.ts, level-progression-handler.test.ts, gamestate-level-integration.test.ts)
No regressions in core GameState functionality
🔧 Key Features Tested
Validation Logic: All level configurations are validated for data integrity
Navigation Logic: Level advancement and boundary conditions
Integration Logic: GameState properly integrates with level management
Persistence Logic: Scores persist while move limits reset appropriately
Sound Logic: Correct sound events generated for different transition types
Error Handling: Graceful handling of edge cases and invalid states
Performance: Efficient operations under load
The comprehensive test suite ensures that the level management system is robust, reliable, and meets all specified requirements. All tests follow TypeScript best practices and use modern testing patterns with Vitest.
