The hud is now longer than the width of the maze. The hud should be the same length as the width of the maze

I need to examine the current HUD implementation and the maze dimensions to fix the width issue. Let me start by looking at the relevant files.

Now I can see the issue! The HUD is using var(--maze-width) which is calculated in the App.tsx component, but there's a mismatch in the calculation. Let me check how the maze width is being calculated:

Read file(s)

App.css
Now I understand the issue. Looking at the code in App.tsx, the maze width calculation is:

const calculatedWidth = `calc(${mazeWidth} * 32px + ${(mazeWidth - 1) * 2}px + 20px)`;
But in the CSS, the HUD is using:

width: var(--maze-width, calc(16 * 32px + 12px));
The problem is in the maze.css where the HUD has a fallback calculation that doesn't match the actual calculation. The actual calculation includes:

mazeWidth * 32px (cells)
(mazeWidth - 1) * 2px (gaps between cells)
20px (padding: 10px on each side)
But the fallback in CSS only has calc(16 * 32px + 12px) which is missing the gap calculation and has incorrect padding.

Let me fix this by updating the CSS:

Wait, I need to check the actual gap calculation. Let me look at the maze grid styling to understand the gap:

Searched workspace
Looking for gap settings in the maze grid
I see the issue now! The maze grid has gap: 0, so there are no gaps between cells. Let me correct the calculation. The actual width should be:

mazeWidth * 32px (cells)
20px (padding: 10px on each side)
But looking at the App.tsx code again, it's calculating gaps as (mazeWidth - 1) * 2px even though the CSS shows gap: 0. This seems like an inconsistency. Let me check what the actual calculation in App.tsx is doing:

Searched workspace
Looking for the maze width calculation in App.tsx
The issue is that the App.tsx is calculating gaps that don't exist in the CSS. Since the maze grid has gap: 0, the correct calculation should only include cells and padding. Let me fix the App.tsx calculation:

Now let me also fix the CSS fallback to match this calculation:

Perfect! Now the HUD width calculation matches the actual maze width calculation. The changes I made:

Fixed the maze width calculation in App.tsx: Removed the incorrect gap calculation since the CSS shows gap: 0 for the maze grid. Now it correctly calculates: mazeWidth * 32px + 20px (cells + padding).

Updated the CSS fallback values: Changed the fallback width calculation in both .hud and .mobile-controls from calc(16 * 32px + 30px + 20px) to calc(16 * 32px + 20px) to match the corrected calculation.

The HUD should now be exactly the same width as the maze grid, with both using the consistent calculation of cell width (32px per cell) plus padding (10px on each side = 20px total).
