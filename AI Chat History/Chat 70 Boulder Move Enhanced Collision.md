I'll implement task 6: "Create enhanced collision detection for boulders". Let me start by updating the task status and then examining the current collision detection system.

Task: 6. Create enhanced collision detection for boulders from 
tasks.md

Now I have a good understanding of the current system. Based on the requirements and the existing code, I need to enhance the collision detection system to:

Handle collisions between boulders and all game objects (rock, soil, diamond, bomb, arrow, player, exit, other boulders)
Add specific collision handling for boulder-player interactions
Create collision sound event mapping for different object types
Write comprehensive unit tests

I see the issue. The tests are failing because my logic for player and bomb collisions is incorrect. When a boulder hits a player or bomb, it should still move to that position (the boulder doesn't stop before the collision, it moves to the position and then the collision happens). Let me fix the logic:

I see the issue. The tests are expecting shouldStopBoulder to be true for player and bomb collisions, but I changed it to false. Let me fix the tests to match the correct behavior. According to the requirements, when a boulder hits a player, it should cause death and stop at the player's position. When it hits a bomb, it should stop and trigger explosion. Let me correct the logic:

Now I need to update the enhanced boulder fall logic to handle these special cases correctly. The boulder should move to the position and then the special effects happen:

Accepted edits to

collision-detection.ts


Wait, I think I understand the issue now. The problem is that the canBoulderFall function is using the enhanced collision detection, which returns hasCollision: true for player and bomb, so the boulder never tries to fall in the first place. Let me check the canBoulderFall function and see what's happening:

Read file(s)

Let me find the canBoulderFall function:

Finding the canBoulderFall function
I see the issue. The canBoulderFall function is using detectBoulderCollision which returns hasCollision: true for player and bomb. But according to the requirements, boulders should be able to fall onto players and bombs (causing death and explosion respectively). Let me fix this:

Excellent! All tests are now passing. Now let me add some additional tests to cover edge cases and ensure the enhanced collision detection integrates properly with the existing physics engine. Let me also add tests for the canBoulderFall function with player and bomb scenarios:

I see there's a failing test. Let me examine what this test is expecting:

Read file(s)

boulder-audio-events.test.ts 290 - 326
I see the issue. The existing test expects that boulders don't generate collision sounds when hitting diamond, bomb, exit, or player because it assumes the boulder "moves through them". However, my enhanced collision detection now properly generates collision sounds for these objects.

Looking at the requirements, this is actually correct behavior - boulders should generate collision sounds when hitting all objects. The test was written based on the old, incomplete collision detection. Let me check what the requirements say:

From the requirements:

5.1: WHEN a boulder collides with a rock THEN the boulder SHALL stop moving
5.2: WHEN a boulder collides with soil THEN the boulder SHALL stop moving
5.3: WHEN a boulder collides with a diamond THEN the boulder SHALL stop moving
5.4: WHEN a boulder collides with a bomb THEN the boulder SHALL stop moving AND the bomb SHALL explode
5.5: WHEN a boulder collides with an arrow THEN the boulder SHALL stop moving
5.6: WHEN a boulder collides with another boulder THEN both boulders SHALL stop moving
5.7: WHEN a boulder collides with the exit THEN the boulder SHALL stop moving
And from requirement 2.2: WHEN a boulder collides with any object (rock, soil, diamond, bomb, arrow, or player) THEN the system SHALL play the COLLISION_THUD sound effect

So my implementation is correct - all collisions should generate sounds. The test needs to be updated to reflect the correct behavior. However, since this is an existing test that was working before, I should be more careful. Let me check if the issue is that my enhanced collision detection is being used when it shouldn't be.

Let me check what simulateGravityWithState uses:

Searched workspace
Checking what simulateGravityWithState uses for collision detection
Read file(s)

physics-engine.ts 76 - 121
I see that simulateGravityWithState uses simulateBoulderFall, which I updated to use the enhanced collision detection. The issue is that the old test was written expecting the old behavior where diamonds, bombs, exits, and players didn't generate collision sounds.

However, according to the requirements I'm implementing, this is incorrect. The requirements clearly state that boulders should generate collision sounds when hitting ANY object. The test needs to be updated to reflect the correct behavior.

But since I want to be careful not to break existing functionality, let me check if there's a way to maintain backward compatibility. Looking at the test more carefully, I notice it's testing objects that the boulder "moves through" - but according to my requirements, boulders should stop when hitting diamonds, bombs, exits, and players (except for the special cases of player death and bomb explosion).

Let me check the current behavior by looking at what the test is actually testing:

Read file(s)

boulder-audio-events.test.ts 265 - 296
I see the issue now. The test comment says "Test truly non-solid objects that don't generate collision sounds" and it expects that diamonds, bombs, exits, and players are "non-solid" objects that boulders move through without generating collision sounds.

However, this contradicts the requirements I'm implementing. According to the requirements:

Boulders should stop when hitting diamonds (5.3)
Boulders should stop when hitting bombs and trigger explosion (5.4)
Boulders should stop when hitting exits (5.7)
Boulders should cause death when hitting players (4.1)
The test was written based on incomplete collision detection. My enhanced collision detection is correct according to the requirements. I need to update this test to reflect the correct behavior.

But first, let me verify that my understanding is correct by checking if the boulder actually moves in the test. If the boulder doesn't move, then there shouldn't be a collision sound. Let me trace through what happens:

Boulder at (1,1) tries to move to (1,2) where there's a diamond/bomb/exit/player
My enhanced collision detection detects this as a collision
For diamond/exit: boulder stops at (1,1), no movement, but collision is detected
For bomb/player: boulder moves to (1,2), collision sound is generated
The issue might be that I'm generating collision sounds even when the boulder doesn't move. Let me check my logic in simulateGravityWithState:

Read file(s)

physics-engine.ts 115 - 151
I found the issue! In the simulateGravityWithState function, when a boulder doesn't move (line 137), it checks if there were collision events from simulateBoulderFall OR if the boulder can't fall, and then adds a COLLISION_THUD sound.

The problem is that my enhanced canBoulderFall function now returns true for player and bomb collisions (because boulders can fall onto them), but false for diamond and exit collisions. So for diamonds and exits, the condition !canBoulderFall(currentMaze, boulder) is true, which causes a collision sound to be generated even though the boulder didn't move.

This is the source of the test failure. The test expects no collision sound for diamonds, but my logic generates one because the boulder can't fall onto a diamond.

Let me fix this by being more precise about when to generate collision sounds. The collision sound should only be generated when there's an actual collision attempt, not just when a boulder can't fall:

physics-engine.ts


Wait, that's not quite right either. Let me think about this more carefully. The issue is that simulateBoulderFall doesn't generate collision events when the boulder can't fall in the first place. Let me check what happens in the enhanced boulder fall:

Read file(s)

collision-detection.ts 320 - 336
I see the issue. When canBoulderFall returns false (for diamonds and exits), the simulateEnhancedBoulderFall function returns early with empty soundEvents. So there are no collision events generated by simulateBoulderFall.

Then in simulateGravityWithState, the condition !canBoulderFall(currentMaze, boulder) is true for diamonds and exits, so it adds a collision sound.

But according to the test, diamonds, bombs, exits, and players should not generate collision sounds because they are "non-solid" objects that boulders move through. However, this contradicts the requirements.

Let me re-read the requirements more carefully. Looking at the original requirements again:

From requirement 2.2: "WHEN a boulder collides with any object (rock, soil, diamond, bomb, arrow, or player) THEN the system SHALL play the COLLISION_THUD sound effect"

This clearly states that diamonds, bombs, and players should generate collision sounds. The test is incorrect based on the requirements.

However, I need to be careful about breaking existing functionality. Let me check if there's a way to make this work correctly. The key insight is that the test is checking for objects that boulders "move through" - but according to my requirements, boulders should NOT move through diamonds, bombs, exits, or players.

Let me check what the actual behavior should be:

Diamond: Boulder stops, generates collision sound
Bomb: Boulder moves to bomb position, triggers explosion, generates collision sound
Exit: Boulder stops, generates collision sound
Player: Boulder moves to player position, causes death, generates death sound
The test is expecting old behavior where these objects were treated as "passable" but that's incorrect according to the requirements.

I think the right approach is to update the test to reflect the correct behavior according to the requirements. Let me revert my change to the physics engine and instead update the test:

Now let me update the test to reflect the correct behavior according to the requirements. The test should expect collision sounds for diamonds and exits, and death sounds for players, and collision sounds for bombs:

The test is still failing. Let me debug this by checking what sound events are actually being generated. The issue might be that the boulder isn't actually trying to move because it's already marked as moving but can't fall. Let me add some debugging to understand what's happening:

I see the issue! The test shows that for the bomb test, there are no sound events at all ([]). This means the boulder isn't even trying to move. Let me check why.

The issue is likely that the boulder is marked as "moving" in the boulder state manager, but when simulateGravityWithState processes it, it doesn't find it in the list of moving boulders for some reason.

Let me check the logic more carefully. The test does:

Creates a boulder state manager with a boulder at (1,1)
Calls updateBoulderMovement to mark the boulder as moving
Calls simulateGravityWithState with move number 2
But in simulateGravityWithState, it looks for:

Triggered boulders for the current move (move 2)
Boulders that are already moving
The problem might be that the boulder is marked as moving but not triggered for move 2, and the logic for finding already moving boulders might not be working correctly.

Let me add more debugging to understand the boulder state:

Perfect! Now I can see the issue. The boulder state shows:

position: { x: 1, y: 1 }
isTriggered: false
isMoving: true
triggeredOnMove: -1
moving boulder count: 1
So the boulder is marked as moving, but it's not triggered for any specific move. In simulateGravityWithState, the logic looks for:

getTriggeredBouldersForMove(boulderStateManager, 2) - this will return empty because triggeredOnMove: -1
Boulders that are already moving - this should find our boulder
The issue must be in the logic that finds already moving boulders. Let me check that part of the code:

Read file(s)

physics-engine.ts 88 - 106
The logic looks correct. It should find boulders where state.isMoving is true and add their positions to allMovingBoulders. Let me add more debugging to see what's happening in the simulateGravityWithState function:

Great! Now I can see what's happening. The debug output shows that for the bomb test:

Debug simulateGravityWithState:
  triggeredBoulders: []
  currentlyMovingBoulders: [ { x: 1, y: 1 } ]
  uniqueMovingBoulders: [ { x: 1, y: 1 } ]
So the boulder is correctly identified as moving and is in the uniqueMovingBoulders list. But still no sound events are generated. This means the issue is in the boulder processing loop. Let me add more debugging to see what happens when the boulder is processed:
