// Pure function to parse position key back to Position
export function parsePositionKey(key: string): Position {
    const [x, y] = key.split(',').map(Number);
    return { x, y };
}
How do I fix the following problem in the above code?: Type 'number | undefined' is not assignable to type 'number'.
  Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'number'.

The issue is in the parsePositionKey function where split(',').map(Number) could potentially return undefined values if the string doesn't contain valid numbers. Here's the fix:

The fix addresses the TypeScript error by:

Explicit array access: Instead of destructuring directly from map(Number), we access the array elements explicitly
Type safety: We validate that both x and 
boulder-state-manager.ts
 are valid numbers using isNaN()
Error handling: If the parsing fails, we throw a descriptive error rather than returning invalid coordinates
This ensures the function always returns valid Position objects with proper number types for both x and 
boulder-state-manager.ts
 properties.

// Create recovered state with safe defaults
const recoveredState: BoulderState = {
    position: recoveryPosition,
    isTriggered: false, // Reset to safe state
    isMoving: false,    // Reset to safe state
How do I fix the following problem in the above code?: Type 'Position | undefined' is not assignable to type 'Position'.
  Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'Position'.

The issue is that boulderPositions[0] could potentially be undefined if the array is empty, even though we check for boulderPositions.length === 0 right before. TypeScript doesn't recognize that the array access is safe. Here's the fix:

The fix uses the non-null assertion operator (!) to tell TypeScript that boulderPositions[0] is guaranteed to be defined. This is safe because we explicitly check boulderPositions.length === 0 just before this line and return early if the array is empty, so we know the array has at least one element when we reach this point.

The non-null assertion is appropriate here because:

We've already validated that boulderPositions.length > 0
The array access happens immediately after the length check
The logic guarantees the element exists at index 0
