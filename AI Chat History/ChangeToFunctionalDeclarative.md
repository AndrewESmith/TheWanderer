## üí° What is Declarative Programming?

**Declarative programming** is a paradigm that focuses on **what** the program should accomplish rather than **how** to do it.

### Key Characteristics:

- Describes logic, not control flow
- Abstracts away implementation details
- Common in data querying, configuration, and UI design

### Examples:

- **SQL**: You declare what data you want.
- **HTML**: You describe the structure of a webpage.
- **Prolog**: Logic-based declarative language.
- **Functional constructs** in languages like Haskell and JavaScript.

## üîç Declarative vs. Imperative Programming

| Feature      | Declarative        | Imperative      |
| ------------ | ------------------ | --------------- |
| Focus        | What to do         | How to do it    |
| Control Flow | Hidden             | Explicit        |
| Examples     | SQL, HTML, Haskell | C, Java, Python |

## üóÇÔ∏è Code Examples

### Task: Filter even numbers from a list

#### ‚úÖ Imperative Style (Python)

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_numbers = []

for number in numbers:
    if number % 2 == 0:
        even_numbers.append(number)

print(even_numbers)
```

- How it works: You explicitly tell the computer how to loop through the list, check each number, and store the even ones.

### ‚úÖ Declarative Style (Python using filter and lambda)

```Python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))

print(even_numbers)
```

- How it works: You declare what you want (filter even numbers), and Python handles the iteration and logic internally.

### üß† Summary

| Style       | Focuses On      | Example Feature              |
| ----------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Imperative  | How to do it    | Loops, conditionals          |
| Declarative | What to achieve | filter(), map(), SQL queries |

## üí° is declarative programming appropriate for Object Oriented coding?

Great question! The relationship between declarative programming and object-oriented programming (OOP) is nuanced. Here's a breakdown:

üß† Can Declarative Programming Be Used in OOP?

Yes, but with limitations and specific use cases. While OOP is traditionally imperative, you can incorporate declarative styles within OOP codebases, especially in areas like:

‚úÖ UI Frameworks
React (JavaScript): Uses declarative syntax to describe UI components.

```jsx

<Button disabled={isLoading}>Submit</Button>

```

This is declarative, even though React components are objects.

## ‚úÖ Configuration and Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs)

Tools like Spring (Java) or Django (Python) use declarative annotations or decorators:

```Python
@login_required
def view_profile(request):
    ...
```

## ‚úÖ Functional Features in OOP Languages

Languages like Scala, Kotlin, and Python support functional/declarative constructs like map, filter, and lambda.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges of Mixing Declarative with OOP

State Management: Declarative code avoids mutable state, while OOP often relies on it.
Encapsulation: Declarative logic can bypass object boundaries, reducing encapsulation.
Debugging: Declarative code can be harder to trace because control flow is abstracted.

## üß© Best Practices

Use declarative style for:

- UI rendering
- Configuration
- Data transformation
  
Use OOP for:

- Modeling complex systems
- Managing state and behavior
- Structuring large applications

## üí° is it better to use Declarative and functional programming for typescript?

### Copilot

Using declarative and functional programming in TypeScript can be a very effective approach, especially for building clean, maintainable, and scalable applications. Here's a breakdown of why and when it's beneficial:

‚úÖ Benefits of Declarative & Functional Programming in TypeScript
1. Improved Readability
Declarative code expresses what you want to do, not how to do it. This makes your code easier to understand at a glance.

```TypeScript
// Declarative
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(n => n % 2 === 0);
```

2. Less Side Effects
 
Functional programming encourages pure functions (no side effects), which makes your code more predictable and easier to test.

3. Better Type Safety

TypeScript‚Äôs strong typing works well with functional patterns like map, filter, and reduce, helping catch bugs early.

4. Composability
Functional programming promotes small, reusable functions that can be composed together, which aligns well with modular TypeScript codebases.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è When to Be Cautious

- Performance: Functional patterns like chaining .map().filter().reduce() can be less performant than imperative loops in tight, performance-critical code.
- Complexity: Overusing functional abstractions (e.g., monads, currying) can make code harder to understand for teams unfamiliar with FP.
- State Management: Functional programming avoids mutable state, which can be tricky when dealing with UI frameworks or complex app logic.

```TypeScript
type User = { name: string; age: number };

const users: User[] = [
  { name: "Alice", age: 25 },
  { name: "Bob", age: 17 },
  { name: "Charlie", age: 30 },
];

// Declarative + Functional
const adults = users.filter(user => user.age >= 18).map(user => user.name);

console.log(adults); // ["Alice", "Charlie"]
```
