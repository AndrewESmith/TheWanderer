I can see there's a failing test related to boulder collision sound handling. Let me examine the test file and the related physics engine code to understand what's happening.

Read file(s)

physics-engine-enhanced.test.ts
Now let me look at the physics engine implementation to see what's happening with the collision sound generation:

Read file(s)

physics-engine.ts
Now let me check the collision detection module to see how collision sounds are generated:

Read file(s)

collision-detection.ts
Now I can see the issue! Looking at the failing test and the code, the problem is in the simulateEnhancedBoulderFall function. The test expects a collision sound when a moving boulder hits a rock and stops, but the current logic only generates collision sounds when the boulder can actually fall but hits something.

Let me examine the specific test case more closely:

The test creates a boulder surrounded by rocks:

[CELL.ROCK, CELL.ROCK, CELL.ROCK],
[CELL.ROCK, CELL.BOULDER, CELL.ROCK],
[CELL.ROCK, CELL.ROCK, CELL.ROCK]
The boulder is marked as moving, but when simulateBoulderFall is called, it checks canBoulderFall first. Since the boulder can't fall (there's a rock below), it returns early with no sound events.

However, the test expects that when a moving boulder tries to move but can't, it should generate a collision sound. Let me fix this:

Now let's run the specific failing test to see if this fixes the issue:

Perfect! All the physics engine tests are now passing. Let's also run a broader test to make sure I didn't break anything else:

Command
npm test -- --run
how can I configure Kiro so that when a full test run is triggered it includes --bail=1 so that the whole test suite isn't run to discover if there are errors generated. For example this command npm test -- --run should be npm test -- --run --bail=1

Kiro
You can configure this in your test script or Vitest configuration. Let me check your current setup and show you the best approach.

Read file(s)

package.json
Read file(s)

vitest.config.ts
You have a few options to add --bail=1 to your test runs. Here are the best approaches:

Option 1: Update the test script in package.json (Recommended)
Accepted edits to

package.json


Option 2: Add it to your Vitest configuration
Alternatively, you could add it directly to your vitest.config.ts:

vitest.config.ts


Now when you run npm test, it will automatically stop after the first test failure. Let's test it:

Perfect! Now your test configuration is set up to bail on the first failure. Here's what I've configured:

Summary of Changes
Updated package.json: Added --bail=1 to the test script
Updated vitest.config.ts: Added bail: 1 to the test configuration
How it works
--bail=1 (or bail: 1 in config) tells Vitest to stop running tests after the first failure
This saves time during development when you want to fix issues one at a time
The configuration applies to both the npm script and the Vitest config, so it's redundant but ensures it always works
Usage
Now when you run:

npm test - Will bail on first failure
npm test -- --run - Will bail on first failure
npm test -- --run src/specific/test.ts - Will bail on first failure
If you ever want to run all tests regardless of failures, you can override it with:

npm test -- --bail=false or npm test -- --no-bail
The configuration is now optimized for faster feedback during development!
