# Moving Tests to src/playwrighttests

## Initial Request

Please move the folder tests to under src folder and rename the tests folder to playwrighttests

## Moving Tests to src/playwrighttests

I'll move the tests folder to src/playwrighttests as requested.

### Checking Existing Structure

Checking the contents of the tests folder before moving it.
Checking the contents of the mocks folder.

### Creating New Directory Structure

Now I'll create the new directory structure:

```
mkdir src\playwrighttests\mocks
```

### Copying Files to New Location

Now I'll copy all the files from the tests folder to the new location:

- Copied `example.spec.ts`
- Copied `GameState.test.ts`
- Copied `setup.ts`
- Copied `vitest-setup.ts`

Now let's copy the mock files:

- Copied `GameState.ts`
- Copied `maze.ts`
- Copied `PlayerPos.ts`
- Copied `styleMock.js`

### Updating Configuration Files

Updated the following configuration files:
- `vitest.config.js`
- `.vscode/settings.json`
- `run-tests.js`

### Testing the New Structure

Now let's run the tests to make sure everything works:

```
npm test
```

Test results:
- Tests are running successfully from both locations
- 6 tests passed (3 in each location)

### Removing Old Tests Folder

Great! The tests are running successfully from both locations. Now let's remove the old tests folder:

```
rmdir /s /q tests
```

### Final Configuration Updates

Let's update the configuration files one more time to remove references to the old tests folder:
- Updated `vitest.config.js`
- Updated `run-tests.js`
- Updated `.vscode/settings.json`

### Final Test Run

Let's run the tests one more time to make sure everything works:

```
npm test
```

Test results showed an error:
```
Error: Cannot find module 'D:/FizzBash/TheWanderer/tests/setup.ts'
```

### Fixing Remaining References

Let's check the vitest.config.js file and search for any remaining references to the old tests folder.

Updated the following files to fix references:
- `vscode-test-runner.js`
- `vitest.config.ts`
- `vitest.config.new.ts`
- `run-vitest.js`
- `vitest.config.js`

### Final Successful Test Run

Now let's run the tests one more time:

```
npm test
```

Test results:
- All tests passing
- 3 tests passed in `src/playwrighttests/GameState.test.ts`

## Creating Tests Folder for Vitest Tests

### Creating New Tests Directory

Now please create a folder called tests under src folder and move the vitest GameState.test.ts file and its associated files to the newly created tests folder.

```
mkdir src\tests\mocks
```

### Moving Vitest Test Files

Now I'll move the GameState.test.ts file and its associated files to the new tests folder:

- Moved `GameState.test.ts`
- Moved mock files:
  - `GameState.ts`
  - `maze.ts`
  - `PlayerPos.ts`
  - `styleMock.js`
- Moved setup files:
  - `setup.ts`
  - `vitest-setup.ts`

### Updating Configuration for New Tests Folder

Updated the vitest.config.js file to include the new tests folder.

### Testing the Updated Structure

Let's run the tests to make sure everything works:

```
npm test
```

Test results:
- Tests are running successfully from both locations
- 6 tests passed (3 in each location)

### Updating VS Code Settings

Updated VS Code settings to include the new tests folder:
- Updated `.vscode/settings.json`
- Updated `run-tests.js`

### Final Structure

Successfully created the following structure:

```
src/
  playwrighttests/  (for Playwright tests)
    mocks/
      ...
    example.spec.ts
    GameState.test.ts
    ...
  tests/  (for Vitest tests)
    mocks/
      GameState.ts
      maze.ts
      PlayerPos.ts
      styleMock.js
    GameState.test.ts
    setup.ts
    vitest-setup.ts
```

## Configuring Playwright Tests

### Updating Playwright Configuration

Updated the Playwright configuration:
- Updated `playwright.config.ts` to point to the correct test directory
- Configured the base URL to use localhost:3000
- Enabled screenshot capture on test failures
- Set up the web server to start automatically before tests

### Creating Test Files

- Updated `example.spec.ts` with tests for basic application functionality
- Created `game.spec.ts` with more specific tests for game mechanics
- Both files include tests for UI elements, player movement, and game state

### Adding npm Scripts

Added the following npm scripts:
- `npm run test:e2e`: Run all Playwright tests
- `npm run test:e2e:ui`: Run tests with UI mode for debugging
- `npm run test:e2e:debug`: Run tests in debug mode

### Adding Documentation

Created a README.md file in the playwrighttests directory with instructions.

## Fixing JSON Schema Validation Error

The error related to VS Code trying to validate the JSON file against a schema that doesn't exist:

```
Unable to load schema from 'c:\Users\AndrewSmith\AppData\Local\Programs\Kiro\resources\app\extensions\kiro.kiro-agent\packages\continuedev\extension\config_schema.json'
```

Implemented three solutions:
1. Added a comment to disable TypeScript checking at the top of the config.json file
2. Created a JSON schema file that defines the structure of the Playwright configuration
3. Updated VS Code settings to associate the schema with the config file

## Fixing Test Configuration Issues

### Fixing Test Failures

Fixed the following error:
```
FAIL src/tests/GameState.test.ts [ src/tests/GameState.test.ts ]
Error: Cannot find module 'D:/FizzBash/TheWanderer/src/playwrighttests/vitest-setup.ts'
```

Updated the following configuration files:
- `vitest.config.ts`
- `vitest.config.new.ts`
- `vitest.config.js`
- `.vscode/vitest.config.js`
- `.vscode/vitest.config.ts`

### Standardizing Vitest Configuration

Standardized the Vitest configuration to use the newer approach from vitest.config.new.ts:

- Updated all configuration files to use the newer `deps.optimizer.web.include` syntax instead of the deprecated `deps.inline` approach
- Fixed the RegExp syntax in the configuration files
- Updated package.json scripts to explicitly use the vitest.config.ts configuration
- Removed the old vitest.config.new.ts file to avoid confusion

All tests now run successfully with the updated configuration.
