I'll implement task 12 to add E2E tests for user workflows. Let me start by updating the task status and then examining the existing test structure.

Task: 12. Add E2E tests for user workflows from 
tasks.md
Status: In Progress
Let me first examine the existing test structure to understand how E2E tests are organized in this project.

Searched workspace
Exploring the src directory to understand the test structure
I can see there's already a Playwright test file for the how-to-play popup. Let me examine the existing E2E tests to understand the current structure and what needs to be added.

Read file(s)

how-to-play-popup.spec.ts
Now let me check the existing game flow E2E tests to understand the testing patterns:

Read file(s)

game-flow-e2e.spec.ts
Now let me check the Playwright configuration to understand the test setup:

Read file(s)

playwright.config.ts
Now let me examine the existing how-to-play components to understand the structure:

Read file(s)

HowToPlayPopup.tsx

use-how-to-play-settings.ts
Now let me check how the popup is integrated in the main App component:

Searched workspace
Finding how the popup is integrated in the main App component
Read file(s)

App.tsx 1 - 81
Let me get more of the App.tsx file to see the popup integration:

Now I have a good understanding of the existing structure. Let me create comprehensive E2E tests for the user workflows. Based on the task requirements, I need to test:

New user experience with automatic popup display
Returning user experience with popup suppression
Settings access workflow for reopening instructions
Responsive behavior on different screen sizes
Canceled creation

how-to-play-user-workflows.spec.ts

I see you have a TypeScript project with Playwright tests open. The active file is src/playwrighttests/how-to-play-user-workflows.spec.ts which appears to be testing how-to-play functionality.

What would you like me to help you with? I can:

Review and improve the Playwright test file
Help with the how-to-play popup implementation
Work on any of the tasks or requirements in your specs
Debug any issues you're encountering
Help with TypeScript best practices
Just let me know what you'd like to focus on!
