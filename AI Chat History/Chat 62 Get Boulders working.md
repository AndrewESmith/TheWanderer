New Session





Using #BoulderBehaviour.md as a guide please create the specs needed to refine how boulders behave in a maze

I'll help you create a spec for refining boulder behavior in the maze game. Let me first check if there are any existing specs and then create a comprehensive requirements document based on the boulder behavior instructions.

Check for existing specs to see if there's already a boulder-related spec or if we need to create a new one

Now I'll create a comprehensive spec for boulder behavior refinement. Based on the instructions and current game context, I can see this is a maze game with various interactive elements, and the boulder behavior needs to be refined with specific movement rules, audio feedback, and player interaction constraints.

Do the requirements look good? If so, we can move on to the design.

Great! Now I'll move on to creating the design document. Let me first research the current game architecture to understand how to best integrate the boulder behavior system.

Does the design look good? If so, we can move on to the implementation plan.

Perfect! Now I'll create the implementation plan with actionable coding tasks based on the requirements and design.

Do the tasks look good?

Excellent! I've successfully created a comprehensive spec for boulder behavior refinement in your maze game. The spec includes:

What We've Created
Requirements Document - Defines 6 main requirements covering:

Proximity-based boulder triggering
Audio feedback for movement and collisions
Player movement constraints during boulder motion
Player death mechanics from boulder collisions
Boulder interactions with all game objects
System integration with existing architecture
Design Document - Provides detailed technical design including:

Component architecture with data flow diagrams
Enhanced interfaces for boulder state management
Integration points with existing physics engine
Comprehensive error handling strategy
Performance optimization considerations
Testing strategy across unit, integration, and end-to-end levels
Implementation Plan - Contains 12 actionable coding tasks that:

Build incrementally from core infrastructure to complete features
Include comprehensive unit testing for each component
Focus on integration with your existing TypeScript/React architecture
Follow functional programming patterns consistent with your codebase
Reference specific requirements to ensure complete coverage
Next Steps
The spec is now complete and ready for implementation. You can begin executing tasks by opening the tasks.md file and clicking "Start task" next to any task item. I recommend starting with task 1 (boulder state management infrastructure) as it provides the foundation for all subsequent tasks.

The implementation will enhance your existing boulder system to provide the precise, audio-rich, and strategically engaging boulder mechanics described in your original instructions.
