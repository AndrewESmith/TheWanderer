New Session





Mobile portrait and landscape are still not scaling correctly. In portrait mode the maze is still not centred to the screen and is shifted right. In landscape mode the HUD cuts off the maze and the HUD and mouse controls need to shrink in size to better fit the screen layout

I'll help you fix the mobile scaling issues. Let me first examine the current CSS and App.tsx to understand the layout structure.

Read file(s)

maze.css

App.tsx
Now let me check the current viewport meta tag and any existing mobile-specific styles:

I can see the issues with mobile scaling. Let me fix them:

Portrait mode centering: The maze is shifted right because the scaling and centering calculations aren't working properly
Landscape mode HUD overlap: The HUD is taking up too much space and the mobile controls need to be smaller
Overall mobile responsiveness: Need better viewport handling and scaling
Let me update the CSS to fix these issues:

Perfect! The mobile scaling fixes are now implemented. Here's what I've improved:

Mobile Portrait Mode Fixes:
Centering: Fixed the maze centering by using transform-origin: center center and proper flexbox alignment
Scaling: Improved scaling calculation to use calc((100vw - 16px) / var(--maze-pixel-width)) for better fit
HUD positioning: Moved HUD above the maze using order: -1 for better layout flow
Responsive margins: Reduced padding and margins for better space utilization
Mobile Landscape Mode Fixes:
HUD size: Made HUD much more compact with smaller font sizes (9px) and minimal padding
Mobile controls: Reduced button sizes to 32x32px with smaller gaps
Scaling: Better dual-axis scaling that considers both width and height constraints
Layout: Used flexbox with proper ordering to prevent HUD from cutting off the maze
Additional Improvements:
Viewport meta tag: Added user-scalable=no and viewport-fit=cover for better mobile handling
Touch optimization: Added touch-action manipulation and tap highlight colors
Text selection: Disabled text selection on mobile UI elements
Dynamic viewport: Used 100dvh for better mobile browser compatibility
Key Changes Made:
Better centering: Used transform-origin: center center instead of center top
Improved scaling: More precise calculations with reduced margins
Compact landscape HUD: Dramatically reduced HUD size in landscape mode
Smaller mobile controls: Reduced button sizes and gaps in landscape
Better viewport handling: Updated meta tag for optimal mobile experience
The maze should now be properly centered in portrait mode and the HUD should no longer cut off the maze in landscape mode, with appropriately sized mobile controls for both orientations.
