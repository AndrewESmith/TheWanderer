I can see there's a failing test in the sound system infrastructure. The test expects 9 sound assets but is finding 10. Let me examine the test file and the sound configuration to understand what's happening.

Read file(s)

sound-system-infrastructure.test.ts
Now let me check the sound configuration file to see what sound assets are actually defined:

Read file(s)

sound-config.ts
I can see the issue! The SOUND_ASSETS object now has 10 items instead of 9. There's a new BOMB_SOUND that was added, but the test is still expecting only 9 sound assets. I need to update the test to account for this new sound asset.

I also need to update the SOUND_IDS constant in the sound config to include the new BOMB_SOUND, and then update the test that checks for sound ID constants:

Now let me run the test to see if it passes:

Perfect! The test is now passing. The issue was that a new BOMB_SOUND was added to the SOUND_ASSETS configuration, making it 10 sound assets instead of the expected 9. I've updated:

The test to expect 10 sound assets instead of 9
Added a check for the new BOMB_SOUND asset
Updated the SOUND_IDS constant to include the new BOMB_SOUND ID
The sound system infrastructure test is now passing with all 5 test cases successful. The test properly validates that all 10 sound assets are defined, including the newly added bomb sound.
