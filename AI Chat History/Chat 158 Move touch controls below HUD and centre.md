I'll help you move the mobile controls below the HUD and center them in relation to the maze. Let me first examine the current App.tsx file to understand the current layout structure.

Now let me check the CSS file to understand the current styling for mobile controls and HUD:

Let me also check the maze.css file to see the current mobile controls styling:

Now I can see the current layout structure. The mobile controls are currently positioned above the HUD, and I need to move them below the HUD and center them in relation to the maze. Let me modify the App.tsx file to reorder the elements:

Now I need to update the CSS to center the mobile controls in relation to the maze width. I'll modify the maze.css file to update the mobile controls styling:

Perfect! I've made the necessary changes to move the mobile controls below the HUD and center them in relation to the maze. Here's what I changed:

Changes Made:
Reordered elements in App.tsx: Moved the mobile controls section from above the HUD to below it in the JSX structure.

Updated mobile controls CSS: Modified the .mobile-controls class in maze.css to:

Use margin: 16px auto instead of margin: 16px 0 to center horizontally
Set width: var(--maze-width, calc(16 * 32px + 12px)) to match the maze width
Added justify-content: center for additional centering
Result:
The mobile controls are now:

Positioned below the HUD instead of above it
Centered horizontally in relation to the maze width
Maintaining the same responsive behavior (only showing on touch devices or small screens)
The layout order is now: Maze → HUD → Mobile Controls, with the mobile controls perfectly centered to match the maze's width.
