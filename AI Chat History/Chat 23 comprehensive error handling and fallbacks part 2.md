I'll implement task 9 which focuses on adding comprehensive error handling and fallbacks to the sound system. Let me start by examining the current audio implementation to understand what needs error handling.

Now let me examine the existing error handling and fallback implementations to understand what's already in place:

Now let me check the existing tests to understand what error handling tests already exist:

The error handling test file appears to be incomplete. Let me check what audio manager implementations exist:

Finding all AudioManager class implementations
Great! I can see that there are already three AudioManager implementations: WebAudioManager, HTML5AudioManager, and SilentAudioManager. Let me examine the complete audio-manager.ts file to understand the current error handling implementation:

Now I need to examine the current error handling implementation more closely. Let me check what's missing from the current implementation by looking at the requirements:

design.md 1 - 51
Based on my analysis of the current implementation and the task requirements, I can see that there's already substantial error handling in place, but there are some gaps that need to be addressed. Let me implement the comprehensive error handling and fallbacks as specified in task 9.

The current implementation already has:

WebAudioManager with extensive error handling
HTML5AudioManager as a fallback
SilentAudioManager for unsupported browsers
Audio context suspension handling
Some error recovery mechanisms
However, I need to enhance and complete:

More comprehensive error handling tests
Better fallback mechanisms
Enhanced error recovery for failed sound file loads
More robust autoplay policy handling
Complete the error handling test file
Let me start by completing the error handling test file:

Now I need to enhance the WebAudioManager to add some missing error handling features. Let me add the missing methods and improve the error handling:

Let me continue reading the WebAudioManager to see what's already implemented:

Let me continue reading to see the complete implementation:

I can see that the WebAudioManager already has extensive error handling. Let me check what specific enhancements are needed by looking at the task requirements more closely. Let me add some missing error handling features and create additional fallback mechanisms:

Let me search for the reinitializeAudioContext method to see where it is:

Let me read the actual reinitializeAudioContext method:

Now let me add the enhanced error handling methods after the existing reinitializeAudioContext method:

Now I need to integrate these new error recovery methods into the existing error handling. Let me update the handleLoadError method to use the new recovery mechanisms:

Can you copy all the text in this session to a file called "Chat 24 comprehensive error handling and fallbacks part 2.md" and put the file "Chat 23 comprehensive error handling and fallbacks part 2.md" in to the folder "AI Chat History"
