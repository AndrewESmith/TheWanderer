Items in the hud do not need to be centred they can appear on one or more lines depending upon fit

I can see you're working on a project with TypeScript/JavaScript and have some files open. The active file appears to be a chat history about creating a wrapper to center controls, and you mentioned that HUD items don't need to be centered and can appear on multiple lines.

What would you like me to help you with? Are you looking to:

Modify the HUD layout to allow multi-line display?
Update the control wrapper implementation?
Work on something else in your project?
Let me know what you'd like to focus on and I'll help you get it sorted.

the className HUD in app.tsx has various classes within. labels, values and controls should appear on a single line or wrap to fit the hud control for both web and mobile devices

Kiro
I'll help you update the HUD layout in App.tsx to ensure labels, values, and controls display properly on a single line or wrap appropriately for both web and mobile devices.

App.tsx
Now let me check the CSS file to see the current HUD styling:

maze.css
I can see the issue. The HUD has duplicate styles and the current layout has the left side in a column layout, which isn't ideal for fitting labels, values, and controls on single lines or wrapping properly. Let me update the HUD styles to create a more flexible layout that works well on both web and mobile:

Now I need to remove the duplicate HUD styles at the bottom of the file:

Now I need to update the existing game status styles to work with the new layout and ensure they're properly integrated:

Let me also add some additional responsive improvements for very small screens:

Perfect! I've updated the HUD layout to be more flexible and responsive. Here's what I changed:

Key improvements:
Flexible wrapping layout: The hud-left section now uses flex-wrap: wrap with proper gap spacing, allowing labels, values, and controls to flow naturally on single lines or wrap as needed.

Better spacing: Updated gap values to provide consistent spacing between elements (8px-12px horizontal, 6px-10px vertical).

Responsive design:

On larger screens: Items display in a flexible row layout
On medium screens (≤600px): Switches to column layout with centered content
On small screens (≤400px): More compact spacing and smaller fonts
Improved alignment:

hud-left uses flex: 1 and min-width: 0 for proper text wrapping
hud-right uses flex-shrink: 0 to prevent controls from shrinking
Better vertical alignment with align-items: flex-start
Cleaner styling:

Removed duplicate CSS rules
Consistent font sizes and spacing
Better contrast with rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8) background
Added border-radius for a more modern look
The HUD will now adapt smoothly to different screen sizes while keeping related information grouped logically. Labels, values, and controls will wrap naturally to fit the available space without breaking the layout.

Can we adjust spacing in HUD so that when increases the Moves label and count can stay on the same row

Kiro
I'll adjust the HUD spacing to ensure the Moves label and count stay together on the same row. Let me first read the current CSS to see how it was formatted, then make the adjustment.

Read file(s)

maze.css 150 - 201
Read file(s)

maze.css 120 - 161
Now I can see the current spacing. The issue is that the gap: 8px 12px (8px vertical, 12px horizontal) might not be enough to keep related items together. I'll increase the horizontal gap and also look at the responsive breakpoints to ensure the Moves label and count stay together.

Now let me find and update the responsive breakpoints to ensure consistent spacing:

I'll update the responsive breakpoints to maintain better spacing for the Moves label and count:

Perfect! I've adjusted the HUD spacing to help keep the Moves label and count together:

Changes made:
Desktop/larger screens: Increased horizontal gap from 12px to 16px and reduced vertical gap from 8px to 6px (gap: 6px 16px)

Medium screens (≤600px): Increased horizontal gap from 10px to 14px (gap: 5px 14px)

Small screens (≤400px): Increased horizontal gap from 8px to 12px (gap: 4px 12px)

These adjustments provide more horizontal space between different HUD elements while keeping related content (like "Moves: 15 / 30") closer together. The larger horizontal gaps make it less likely for the Moves label and its count to wrap to separate lines, while the slightly reduced vertical gaps keep the overall HUD compact.

The spacing now prioritizes keeping label-value pairs together while still allowing the HUD to wrap gracefully when screen space is limited.
