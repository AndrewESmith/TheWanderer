I'll take a look at that failing test and fix it for you. Let me first examine the test file to understand what's happening.

Read file(s)

physics-integration-demo.test.ts
Now let me look at line 119 specifically and understand the context around it. The error shows that at line 119, we're expecting 'empty' but getting 'boulder'. Let me examine the exact line:

Read file(s)

physics-integration-demo.test.ts 115 - 126
I can see the issue! Line 119 is expecting the original boulder position gameStateAfterMove2.maze[2]![2] to be CELL.EMPTY (meaning the boulder moved away), but it's still CELL.BOULDER (meaning the boulder didn't move). This suggests the physics simulation isn't working as expected.

Let me examine the related files to understand how the physics and game state work:

Read file(s)

physics-engine.ts

GameState.ts
Now I need to understand what's happening. The test is expecting that after two moves, the boulder should have moved from position (2,2) to (2,3), but it's still at (2,2). Let me check the boulder state manager to understand the triggering mechanism:

Read file(s)

boulder-state-manager.ts
Now I understand the issue! Looking at the boulder state manager, I can see that boulders are triggered on one move but only start moving on the next move. The key function is getTriggeredBouldersForMove:

// Boulder should start moving if it was triggered on the previous move number
// A boulder triggered on move N should start moving on move N+1
if (state.isTriggered &&
    !state.isMoving &&
    state.triggeredOnMove === currentMoveNumber - 1) {
In the test:

Move 1: Player moves right to (2,1), triggering the boulder at (2,2) on move 54 (55-1=54)
Move 2: Player moves right again to (3,1), now on move 53 (54-1=53). The boulder should start moving because it was triggered on move 54, and 54 === 53 + 1 (currentMoveNumber - 1)
But there's a logic error in the test expectation. Let me trace through this more carefully by looking at the collision detection to see how boulder movement actually works:

Read file(s)

collision-detection.ts
Now I understand the issue better. Let me run the test to see the actual output and debug what's happening:

Perfect! Now I can see exactly what's happening. Looking at the debug output:

After move 1: Boulder is triggered on move 54 (triggeredOnMove: 54)
After move 2: Boulder is still at the same position and still has triggeredOnMove: 54, but the current move is 53
The issue is in the boulder triggering logic. The boulder was triggered on move 54, and according to the logic in getTriggeredBouldersForMove, it should start moving when currentMoveNumber - 1 === triggeredOnMove, which would be 53 - 1 === 54, but that's 52 === 54, which is false.

The problem is that the boulder should start moving on move 53 (the move after it was triggered on move 54), but the condition is checking for currentMoveNumber - 1 === triggeredOnMove, which would be 53 - 1 === 54 → 52 === 54 (false).

The logic should be: if a boulder is triggered on move N, it should start moving on move N-1 (since moves count down). Let me fix this:

Perfect! The test is now passing. Looking at the debug output, I can see that:

After move 1: Boulder is triggered on move 54
After move 2: Boulder has moved from position '2,2' to '2,3' and the test output shows "Boulder moved from (2,2) to (2,3)"
The fix was correct. The issue was in the boulder triggering logic where the condition for when a triggered boulder should start moving was incorrect.

Since moves count down (55, 54, 53, ...), when a boulder is triggered on move N, it should start moving on move N-1. The original logic was checking state.triggeredOnMove === currentMoveNumber - 1, but it should be state.triggeredOnMove === currentMoveNumber + 1.

Here's what was happening:

Boulder triggered on move 54 (triggeredOnMove: 54)
On move 53, the condition should be: 54 === 53 + 1 → 54 === 54 ✅ (true)
The old condition was: 54 === 53 - 1 → 54 === 52 ❌ (false)
The test is now working correctly and all 4 tests in the physics integration demo are passing!

I see that my fix broke another test. The change I made to the boulder triggering logic is causing issues with the boulder state manager tests. Let me examine the failing test to understand what the expected behavior should be:

Read file(s)

boulder-state-manager.test.ts 450 - 471
I can see the issue now. The test expects that boulders triggered on move 5 should be returned when checking for move 6. This suggests that the original logic was correct for this test case, but there might be a different issue with the physics integration test.

Let me look at more context around this test to understand the expected behavior:

Read file(s)

boulder-state-manager.test.ts 440 - 481
Now I understand the issue better. Looking at the test comments:

"Check for move 6 (should return boulders triggered on move 5)" - This suggests boulders triggered on move N should start moving on move N+1
"Check for move 6 (boulder was triggered on move 3, should start moving on move 4, not 6)" - This confirms the same logic
But wait, this contradicts what I observed in the physics integration test. Let me check if the move counting is different between the two tests. Let me run the boulder state manager test to see the exact failure:

I see the issue now. The boulder state manager test is using regular incrementing move numbers (5, 6), while the physics integration test is using decrementing move numbers (55, 54, 53).

Let me revert my change and instead look more carefully at the physics integration test to understand why the boulder wasn't moving. The issue might be elsewhere:

We're back to the original issue. The problem is that the boulder is triggered on move 54, but when we check on move 53, the condition state.triggeredOnMove === currentMoveNumber - 1 becomes 54 === 53 - 1 → 54 === 52, which is false.

The issue is that the physics integration test is using a countdown system (moves go from 55 down to 0), while the boulder state manager test is using a count-up system (moves go from 1 up).

I need to understand how the game actually works. Let me look at the GameState to see how moves are handled:

Searched workspace
Searching for how moves are decremented in the game state
Perfect! I can see that in GameState.ts line 132, moves are decremented: const newMoves = gameState.moves - 1. This confirms that the game uses a countdown system.

Now I need to understand why the boulder state manager test uses incrementing moves. Let me look at that test more carefully:

Searched workspace
Searching for how the boulder state manager test sets up move numbers
I see that the boulder state manager test is passing 5 as the initial move number, but it's treating it as if moves increment. However, the actual game decrements moves.

The real issue is that the boulder state manager test is not testing the actual game behavior - it's testing the boulder state manager in isolation with artificial move numbers that increment.

Let me look at the physics integration test more carefully. The issue might be that the boulder triggering logic needs to account for the countdown system. In a countdown system:

Boulder triggered on move 54
Should start moving on move 53 (the next move in the countdown)
The condition should be: state.triggeredOnMove === currentMoveNumber + 1
But this would break the boulder state manager test. Let me check if there's a way to make both work. Let me look at how the boulder state manager is actually used in the game:

Searched workspace
Searching for how getTriggeredBouldersForMove is called in the actual game code
The function is used in physics-engine.ts at line 94. Let me look at how it's called there:

Read file(s)

physics-engine.ts 90 - 101
Now let me trace how this is called from the GameState:

Searched workspace
Searching for how simulatePhysicsStepWithState is called in GameState
Let me see the full call:

Read file(s)

GameState.ts 148 - 156
Perfect! So the physics is called with newMoves, which is the decremented move count. In the physics integration test:

Move 1: newMoves = 54, boulder is triggered on move 54
Move 2: newMoves = 53, physics is called with currentMoveNumber = 53
For the boulder to start moving on move 2, the condition should be: state.triggeredOnMove === currentMoveNumber + 1 → 54 === 53 + 1 → 54 === 54 ✅

But this breaks the boulder state manager test because that test uses incrementing numbers. The issue is that the boulder state manager test is not testing the real game scenario.

Let me fix the boulder state manager test to use the correct countdown logic:

Read file(s)

boulder-state-manager.test.ts 450 - 471
I need to update the boulder state manager test to use countdown logic. Let me first update the triggering logic to use countdown, then fix the test:
