The touch controls should appear directly below and middled relative to the width of the maze. Currently the touch controls are too far to the right

I need to examine the current touch controls implementation to understand how they're positioned and fix the alignment issue. Let me start by looking at the relevant files.

Now I can see the issue! Looking at the CSS for .mobile-controls, I can see that it's using left: 50%; transform: translateX(-50%); which should center it, but there might be an issue with how the width is being calculated or applied.

Let me examine the current CSS more closely. The mobile controls are set to:

width: var(--maze-width, calc(16 * 32px + 20px))
left: 50%; transform: translateX(-50%);
The problem might be that the CSS custom property --maze-width is being set dynamically in the React component, but the mobile controls might not be getting the correct width value or the centering isn't working as expected.

Let me fix this by updating the mobile controls CSS to ensure proper centering:

The issue was that the mobile controls were using position: relative; left: 50%; transform: translateX(-50%); which can cause positioning issues, especially when the parent container doesn't have the expected width or when the CSS custom property isn't being applied correctly.

By removing the positioning and relying on margin: 16px auto, the mobile controls will be properly centered horizontally relative to their parent container. The auto margins will automatically center the element horizontally, and since the width is set to match the maze width using the CSS custom property, it should align perfectly with the maze.

The key changes:

Removed position: relative
Removed left: 50%
Removed transform: translateX(-50%)
Kept margin: 16px auto which will handle the centering automatically
This approach is more reliable because:

It doesn't depend on positioning calculations that might be affected by parent container styles
The auto margins will work regardless of the exact width value
It's simpler and less prone to layout issues
It maintains the width matching with the maze through the CSS custom property
The mobile controls should now appear directly below and centered relative to the maze width.
