New Session





I would like to hide and display the Audio Debug Panel using a check box in Audio Settings. By default the Audio Debug Panel should be hidden.

I'll help you create a spec for adding a checkbox to hide/show the Audio Debug Panel in Audio Settings. Let me first explore the existing specs and audio-related code to understand the current structure.

Searched workspace
Checking existing specs to see if there's already an audio-related spec or if we need to create a new one
Searched workspace
Checking the sound-system spec to see if this feature should be added there

Now let me check the current audio implementation to understand how the Audio Debug Panel is currently structured:

Searched workspace
Searching for existing Audio Debug Panel implementation
Read file(s)

audio-debug.tsx
Now let me check where the Audio Debug Panel is currently being used:

Searched workspace
Finding where AudioDebug component is imported and used
Now let me check if there are any existing audio settings components:

Searched workspace
Looking for existing audio settings components
Let me check if there's already an audio settings component:

Searched workspace
Checking the audio components directory for existing settings components
Perfect! There's already an AudioSettings component. Let me examine it:

Read file(s)

AudioSettings.tsx

AudioSettings.css
Now I have a good understanding of the current structure. The user wants to add a checkbox to the Audio Settings that controls the visibility of the Audio Debug Panel. Based on the existing code, I can see that:

There's already an AudioSettings component with a modal interface
There's an AudioDebug component that's currently always visible in development mode
The audio system is well-established with hooks and context
This is a relatively small feature that extends the existing sound-system spec. Let me create a new spec for this specific feature:

Created

requirements.md


Do the requirements look good? If so, we can move on to the design.

Great! Now I'll create the design document. Let me first research the current audio settings implementation to understand how to best integrate this feature.

Read file(s)

use-audio-settings.ts
Read file(s)

audio-context.tsx
Now let me check how the AudioControl component works to see how the settings modal is triggered:

Read file(s)

AudioControl.tsx
Perfect! Now I have a complete understanding of the current architecture. Let me create the design document:

Created

design.md


Does the design look good? If so, we can move on to the implementation plan.

Perfect! Now I'll create the implementation plan with specific coding tasks:

Created

tasks.md


Do the tasks look good?

Excellent! The spec for the Audio Debug Panel toggle feature is now complete. Here's what we've created:

Spec Summary
Feature: Audio Debug Panel Toggle Location: .kiro/specs/audio-debug-toggle/

What We Built
Requirements Document: Defined 4 main requirements covering:

Toggle visibility from Audio Settings
Persistent preferences across sessions
Development-mode only functionality
Seamless integration with existing audio settings
Design Document: Created a comprehensive design that:

Extends the existing AudioSettings interface
Leverages current state management patterns
Maintains backward compatibility
Ensures production safety
Implementation Plan: Broke down the work into 6 specific coding tasks:

Interface and configuration updates
State management integration
Hook extensions
UI component modifications
Conditional rendering logic
Comprehensive testing
Key Design Decisions
Default Hidden: Audio Debug Panel starts hidden to reduce visual clutter
Development Only: Toggle only appears in development mode for security
Existing Patterns: Uses the same styling and state management as other audio settings
Backward Compatible: Existing localStorage data remains valid
Ready for Implementation
The spec is complete and ready for implementation. You can now:

Start Implementation: Open the tasks.md file and click "Start task" next to any task item
Review the Plan: All tasks are designed to build incrementally on each other
Test-Driven: Each task includes specific testing requirements
The implementation will integrate seamlessly with your existing audio system while providing developers with clean control over the debug panel visibility.
