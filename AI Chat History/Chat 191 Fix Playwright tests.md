I can see you have a failing Playwright test related to player movement with keyboard controls. The test is expecting the player position to change, but it's not moving. Let me examine the test file and related code to help debug this issue.

Read file(s)

hud.spec.ts
Now let me check the current active test file to see if there are any related tests:

Read file(s)

how-to-play-user-workflows.spec.ts
Now let me check the game's main source files to understand how player movement is implemented:

Searched workspace
Exploring the src directory to find the main game files
Let me check the main App.tsx and GameState.ts files to understand the player movement logic:

Read file(s)

App.tsx

GameState.ts

PlayerPos.ts
Now let me check the maze.ts file to understand how the player position is tracked:

Read file(s)

maze.ts
Now I understand the issue! Looking at the failing test and the code, I can see that the test is checking if the player's bounding box position changes after pressing a key, but there might be an issue with how the player position is being updated or rendered.

Let me run the specific failing test to see the exact error:

Perfect! Now I can see the issue clearly. The test is failing because the player position is not changing when the arrow key is pressed. The bounding box remains the same, which means the player is not actually moving.

Looking at the code, I suspect the issue might be related to the How to Play popup blocking input. Let me check if there's a popup that's preventing keyboard input:

Read file(s)

HowToPlayPopup.tsx
Now let me check the hook that manages the How to Play settings:

Read file(s)

use-how-to-play-settings.ts
Now I understand the issue! Looking at the code in App.tsx, I can see that:

The How to Play popup is automatically shown for first-time users
When the popup is open (isHowToPlayOpen is true), the keyboard event handler has this condition:
// Block game input when How to Play popup is open
if (isHowToPlayOpen) return;
The test is failing because when the test runs, it's likely a "first-time user" scenario (no localStorage settings), so the popup automatically opens and blocks keyboard input.

Let me check the test to see if it's handling this popup:

Read file(s)

hud.spec.ts 30 - 61
The test is not handling the How to Play popup at all! That's the issue. The popup is automatically shown for first-time users and blocks keyboard input. Let me fix the test by adding code to handle the popup:

Good progress! 3 out of 5 tests are now passing. The remaining failures are in Mobile Safari and webkit. Let me check if there might be additional issues. Let me look at the screenshot to understand what's happening:

Searched workspace
Looking for test result screenshots to understand the failure
Let me check if there might be timing issues or if the player is actually in a different position. Let me improve the test by adding more debugging and waiting for the game to be fully loaded:

Let me also check if there might be an issue with the player being able to move in the initial position. Let me look at the initial maze to see where the player starts:

Read file(s)

maze.ts 15 - 36
Read file(s)

maze.ts 30 - 46
Perfect! I can see that the player starts at position (1, 3) - row 3, column 1. Looking at the maze, to the right of the player (position 2, 3) is an EMPTY cell, so the player should be able to move right.

However, I notice that the game might be using a level system now instead of the initial maze. Let me check if the game is loading from the level manager:

Read file(s)

maze-level-manager.ts
Great! Now I can see that the game is using Level 1, which uses the initialMaze. Looking at Level 1, the player starts at position (1, 3) and should be able to move right to position (2, 3) which is an EMPTY cell.

However, I suspect there might be a timing issue or the popup is still interfering. Let me try a different approach - instead of just checking if the popup is visible, let me wait for it to appear and then close it:

Perfect! All 20 tests in the hud.spec.ts file are now passing.

Summary
I successfully identified and fixed the failing Playwright test. The issue was that the How to Play popup was automatically appearing for first-time users and blocking keyboard input to the game.

Root Cause
The game shows a "How to Play" popup automatically for new users (when localStorage is empty)
When the popup is open, the keyboard event handler in App.tsx has this condition:
// Block game input when How to Play popup is open
if (isHowToPlayOpen) return;
The test was trying to press arrow keys while the popup was blocking input, so the player never moved
Solution
I updated both failing tests (player moves with keyboard controls and game shows game over when player hits bomb) to:

Clear localStorage to ensure a clean test state
Wait for the popup to appear (since it appears automatically for first-time users)
Close the popup by clicking the close button
Wait for the game to be ready before attempting keyboard input
Ensure proper focus by clicking on the game area
Key Changes Made
Added localStorage clearing at the start of tests
Added proper popup handling with try-catch for robustness
Increased wait times to ensure proper game initialization
Added focus management by clicking on the maze container
The fix ensures that all tests now pass across all browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit, Mobile Chrome, and Mobile Safari) by properly handling the How to Play popup that was blocking game interaction.
