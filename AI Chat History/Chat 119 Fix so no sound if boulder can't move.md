If a boulder can't move then no sound should play when a player passes. Currently the COLLISION_THUD is heard and it should not since the boulder can't move. If the boulder can move please keep in mind #BOULDER_CONTINUOUS_FALLING_FIX.md

I understand the issue. Looking at the BOULDER_CONTINUOUS_FALLING_FIX.md, the problem is that a COLLISION_THUD sound is playing when a player passes by a boulder that can't actually move. This violates the logic - if a boulder can't move, no sound should be generated.

Let me first examine the current sound configuration and then look at the collision detection code to understand where this unwanted sound is being generated.

Read file(s)

sound-config.ts
Now let me examine the collision detection code to see where the COLLISION_THUD sound is being generated inappropriately:

Read file(s)

collision-detection.ts
Now I need to look at where the boulder physics is being triggered to understand when the COLLISION_THUD sound is being generated inappropriately. Let me check the physics engine or game state management:

Searched workspace
Searching for where boulder fall simulation is called and where COLLISION_THUD sound is used
Now let me look at the physics engine to see how boulder movement is triggered:

Read file(s)

physics-engine.ts
Now I need to understand when boulder movement is triggered. Let me check the boulder state manager:

Searched workspace
Searching for where boulder movement is triggered and how the system determines if a boulder should move
Now let me look at the boulder state manager to understand how boulder triggers work:

Read file(s)

boulder-state-manager.ts
Now I need to understand where the boulder triggers are being called from. Let me check the GameState to see how player movement triggers boulder movement:

Searched workspace
Searching for where boulder triggers are called in the game state or player movement logic
Perfect! Now I can see the issue. Let me look at the GameState.ts file to see exactly where the boulder triggers are being called:

Read file(s)

GameState.ts 220 - 251
Now I understand the issue! The problem is that the system is triggering boulders and generating sounds even when the boulders can't actually move. The identifyTriggeredBoulders function identifies boulders adjacent to the player, but it doesn't check if those boulders can actually fall.

According to the BOULDER_CONTINUOUS_FALLING_FIX.md document, if a boulder can't move, no sound should play when a player passes by it. The issue is that the system is triggering boulders (which generates sounds) without first checking if they can actually move.

Let me check the canBoulderFall function to see how we can integrate this check:

Read file(s)

collision-detection.ts 280 - 296
Perfect! Now I understand the solution. The issue is in the identifyTriggeredBoulders function in the boulder state manager. It should only identify boulders that can actually move, not just any boulder adjacent to the player.

Let me modify the identifyTriggeredBoulders function to check if boulders can actually fall before triggering them:

boulder-state-manager.ts


Now I need to update the createProximityResult function to pass the maze parameter:

Accepted edits to

boulder-state-manager.ts


Now I need to update the GameState.ts file to pass the maze to the identifyTriggeredBoulders function:

Accepted edits to

GameState.ts


Now I need to update any tests that call identifyTriggeredBoulders to handle the new optional maze parameter. Let me check which tests need to be updated:

Searched workspace
Finding tests that call identifyTriggeredBoulders to update them for the new maze parameter
The tests in boulder-state-manager.test.ts are testing the basic functionality without maze context, so they should continue to work with the backward compatibility I added. However, let me also check if there are any other files that use this function:

Searched workspace
Checking for other files that might use identifyTriggeredBoulders
I need to update the boulder-performance-integration.ts file as well. Let me check its current implementation:

Read file(s)

boulder-performance-integration.ts
I can see that the performance integration file has its own implementation of identifyTriggeredBoulders that doesn't use the main function. This is fine since it's an optimization layer. The tests should still work because the function signature is backward compatible (the maze parameter is optional).

Let me run the tests to see if there are any issues:

I see the issue. The test is failing because even without the maze parameter, the function is not finding any triggered boulders. Let me debug this by checking what's happening with the boulder positions:

I see the issue. The boulder is at position (1,1) and the player is at position (1,0), but they're not considered adjacent. Let me check the adjacency logic. The player at (1,0) should be adjacent to the boulder at (1,1) since they're vertically adjacent. Let me add more debug info:

Now I can see the issue! The boulder at (1,1) is adjacent to both the previous player position (0,0) and the current player position (1,0). Since the boulder was already adjacent to the player at the previous position, it's not considered "newly triggered" when the player moves to the current position.

The logic is working correctly - it only triggers boulders that become newly adjacent, not ones that were already adjacent. Let me fix the test by using positions where the boulder is not adjacent to the previous position:

I have a circular dependency issue. Let me fix this by importing the function properly at the top of the file instead of using require:

Accepted edits to

boulder-state-manager.ts


Now let me fix the circular dependency by creating a separate function that doesn't import from collision-detection:

Error(s) while editing

Unable to replace text, trying a different approach...
Let me check the current content of the file around that area:

Read file(s)

Now I can fix it. Let me add a simple boulder fall check function and replace the require:

I see there's an issue with the variable scope in GameState.ts. The updatedMaze variable is being used before it's declared. Let me fix this:

Read file(s)

GameState.ts 220 - 251
I need to see more context to understand where updatedMaze is defined:

Read file(s)

GameState.ts 180 - 261
I can see the issue. The updatedMaze variable is declared after it's used. I need to move the declaration before it's used:

Accepted edits to

GameState.ts

Excellent! The tests are now passing. Let me create a summary of the changes I made to fix the issue:

Summary
I successfully fixed the issue where COLLISION_THUD sounds were playing when a player passed by boulders that couldn't actually move. Here's what I implemented:

Problem
The system was triggering boulders (and generating sounds) whenever a player moved adjacent to them, regardless of whether the boulders could actually move. This violated the requirement that "if a boulder can't move then no sound should play when a player passes."

Solution
Modified identifyTriggeredBoulders function in src/physics/boulder-state-manager.ts:

Added an optional maze parameter to check if boulders can actually move
Added a simple canBoulderFallSimple function to avoid circular dependencies
Only triggers boulders that can actually fall (have empty space, soil, player, or bomb below them)
Maintains backward compatibility for existing code that doesn't pass the maze parameter
Updated GameState.ts:

Modified the call to identifyTriggeredBoulders to pass the maze context
Fixed a variable scope issue where updatedMaze was used before declaration
Added comprehensive tests in src/tests/boulder-immovable-sound-fix.test.ts:

Tests that immovable boulders (blocked by rock, other boulders, or at maze bottom) are not triggered
Tests that movable boulders (with empty space, soil, player, or bomb below) are still triggered
Tests edge cases and mixed scenarios
Key Features of the Fix
Preserves BOULDER_CONTINUOUS_FALLING_FIX.md requirements: Boulders that can move still fall continuously until collision
Prevents unwanted sounds: Immovable boulders don't generate COLLISION_THUD sounds when players pass by
Maintains backward compatibility: Existing code continues to work without the maze parameter
Comprehensive testing: All scenarios are covered with proper test cases
Error handling: Graceful fallback if boulder movement check fails
Result
✅ Immovable boulders no longer generate sounds when players pass by
✅ Movable boulders still work correctly and generate appropriate sounds
✅ All existing boulder functionality is preserved
✅ Comprehensive test coverage ensures the fix works correctly
The fix ensures that the boulder sound system now properly respects the physics constraints - only boulders that can actually move will be triggered and generate sounds when a player approaches them.
