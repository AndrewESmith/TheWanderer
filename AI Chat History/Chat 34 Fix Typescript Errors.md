html5-audio-manager.ts 92 - 98



let audio = this.audioElements.get(soundId);

if (!audio || audio.error) {
    audio = this.createAudioElement(soundId, asset.src);
    if (!audio) {
        this.errorHandling.onPlayError(soundId, new Error('Failed to create audio element'));
How do I fix the following problem in the above code?: Type 'HTMLAudioElement | null' is not assignable to type 'HTMLAudioElement | undefined'.
  Type 'null' is not assignable to type 'HTMLAudioElement | undefined'.

The issue is that createAudioElement returns HTMLAudioElement | null, but you're trying to assign it to 
html5-audio-manager.ts
 which is typed as HTMLAudioElement | undefined (from the Map's get method).

The fix is to handle the null case explicitly. Here's the corrected code:

The fix creates a separate variable newAudio to capture the return value from createAudioElement, checks if it's null, and only assigns it to 
html5-audio-manager.ts
 if it's not null. This way TypeScript knows that 
html5-audio-manager.ts
 is definitely an HTMLAudioElement after the null check.

        failedSounds: [],
        errors: new Map()
    };
    this.notifyProgressCallbacks({ progress: 1, loaded: 0, total: 0 });
    return Promise.resolve();
}
How do I fix the following problem in the above code?: Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'loaded' does not exist in type 'LoadingProgress'.

I need to check the LoadingProgress interface to see what properties it expects. Let me search for it first:

Searched workspace
Looking for the LoadingProgress interface definition to understand its structure
Let me get the full definition:

Read file(s)

asset-loader.ts
Now I can see the issue. The LoadingProgress interface expects soundId, progress, status, and optionally error, but the code is trying to pass loaded and total properties which don't exist in the interface.

Looking at the code, it seems like there are two different progress tracking patterns being used. The HTML5AudioManager is trying to use a different progress format than what the LoadingProgress interface defines.

Let me check if there's another progress interface or if we need to adjust the calls:

Searched workspace
Looking for other progress-related interfaces that might have loaded and total properties
I can see that there are different progress callback patterns being used. Looking at the silent-audio-manager.ts, it seems like there should be a different interface that has loaded and total properties. Let me check what interface the notifyProgressCallbacks method expects:

Searched workspace
Looking for the callback signature that expects loaded and total properties
Let me check the silent audio manager to see what interface it's using:

silent-audio-manager.ts 1 - 51
I can see the issue now. The SilentAudioManager is using a different LoadingState interface that has loaded and total properties, but it's trying to use the same LoadingProgress interface from asset-loader.ts which has different properties.

Looking at the code, it seems like there are two different progress tracking systems:

The LoadingProgress interface from asset-loader.ts which has soundId, progress, status, and error
A simpler progress format that has progress, loaded, and total
The HTML5AudioManager should be using the simpler format. Let me check what the actual callback signature should be by looking at the interface definition:

Searched workspace
Looking for the AudioManager interface to see what the onLoadingProgress method expects
Let me check the IAudioManager interface:

Read file(s)

IAudioManager.ts
Now I understand the issue. The interface expects the LoadingProgress from asset-loader.ts, but the HTML5AudioManager is trying to use a different format.

Looking at the SilentAudioManager, it seems like it's incorrectly using the wrong interface too. The correct approach is to create individual progress events for each sound being loaded, not aggregate progress.

Let me fix the HTML5AudioManager to use the correct LoadingProgress format:

Now I need to handle the error cases as well:

How do I fix the following problem in the above code?: Object is possibly 'undefined'.

The error occurs because config.sounds[key] could be undefined if the key doesn't exist in the sounds object. Here's the fix:

The fix adds a null check for config.sounds[key] by storing it in a sound variable and checking if it exists before accessing its id property. This ensures TypeScript knows the object is defined before we try to access its properties.
