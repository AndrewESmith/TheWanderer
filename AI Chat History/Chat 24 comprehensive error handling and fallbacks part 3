I'll implement task 9: "Add comprehensive error handling and fallbacks" from the sound system spec. Let me first read the current audio implementation to understand the existing structure.

Now let me check the existing error handling and fallback implementations to understand what's already in place:

Now let me check the interfaces to understand the expected structure:

Now let me check the existing tests to understand the testing structure:

Now I can see the current state of the audio system. I need to enhance the error handling and fallback mechanisms. Based on the task requirements and existing code, I'll implement comprehensive error handling and fallbacks. Let me start by creating the missing fallback audio managers and enhancing the existing error handling:

audio-manager.ts


Now I need to add the missing methods and complete the WebAudioManager implementation. Let me check what's at the end of the file:

Error(s) while reading file(s)

I can see the file is incomplete. Let me complete the WebAudioManager implementation and add the missing methods:

audio-manager.ts


Now I need to create a comprehensive error handling utility and enhance the existing fallback mechanisms. Let me create a new error handling utility:
