I'll implement task 9 to create unit tests for the settings hook. Let me first examine the existing settings hook to understand its structure and functionality.

Now let me check if there's an existing test directory structure and see what testing framework is being used:

Searched workspace
Checking the existing test directory structure to understand the testing setup
I can see there's already a test file for the settings hook. Let me check its current state:

Read file(s)

use-how-to-play-settings.test.ts
Perfect! I can see that comprehensive unit tests for the settings hook have already been implemented. The test file covers all the requirements specified in the task:

✅ localStorage operations with mocked storage - Tests mock localStorage and test both getItem and setItem operations
✅ Preference management methods (setDontShowAgain, markAsViewed) - Tests both methods with proper state updates and persistence
✅ First-visit detection logic and shouldShowOnStartup method - Tests all scenarios for the shouldShowOnStartup logic
✅ Error handling for localStorage failures - Tests graceful handling of localStorage errors for both loading and saving
Let me run the tests to verify they pass:

Excellent! All 21 tests pass successfully. The test suite is comprehensive and covers all the requirements specified in the task:

Task 9 Implementation Summary
The unit tests for the settings hook have been successfully implemented and are passing. The test suite includes:

✅ localStorage operations with mocked storage
Tests for loading settings from localStorage
Tests for saving settings to localStorage
Proper mocking of localStorage methods
✅ Preference management methods (setDontShowAgain, markAsViewed)
Tests for setDontShowAgain method with state updates and persistence
Tests for markAsViewed method with state updates and persistence
Tests ensuring methods don't interfere with each other
✅ First-visit detection logic and shouldShowOnStartup method
Tests for all scenarios of shouldShowOnStartup logic:
First-time users (default state)
Users who haven't seen instructions
Users who have seen instructions but not opted out
Users who have seen instructions and opted out
Edge case: users who opted out but haven't seen instructions
✅ Error handling for localStorage failures
Tests for graceful handling of localStorage getItem failures
Tests for graceful handling of localStorage setItem failures
Tests for handling corrupted JSON data in localStorage
Tests for handling non-boolean values and partial data
Additional comprehensive coverage:
Integration tests covering complete user workflows
Type safety tests handling edge cases with malformed data
Multiple hook instances ensuring consistency
User workflow scenarios like changing preferences
The test file contains 21 test cases that thoroughly validate all aspects of the settings hook, ensuring it meets all the requirements (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4) specified in the task.

Task: 9. Create unit tests for settings hook from 
tasks.md
Status: Completed
Task 9 is now complete! The comprehensive unit tests for the settings hook are implemented and all tests are passing. The test suite covers all the specified requirements including localStorage operations, preference management methods, first-visit detection logic, and error handling for localStorage failures.
