            headers: new Map()
        } as Response);
    } else {
        resolve({
            ok: true,
            status: 200,
            statusText: 'OK',
            headers: new Map([['content-type', 'audio/mpeg']]),
            arrayBuffer: () => Promise.resolve(new ArrayBuffer(1000))
        } as Response);
    }
}, delay);
How do I fix the following problem in the above code?: Conversion of type '{ ok: true; status: number; statusText: string; headers: Map<string, string>; arrayBuffer: () => Promise<ArrayBuffer>; }' to type 'Response' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
  Type '{ ok: true; status: number; statusText: string; headers: Map<string, string>; arrayBuffer: () => Promise<ArrayBuffer>; }' is missing the following properties from type 'Response': redirected, type, url, clone, and 6 more.

The TypeScript error is occurring because you're trying to cast an incomplete object to the Response type. The mock object is missing several required properties from the Response interface.

Here's the fix - you need to create a more complete mock Response object or cast it through unknown first:

The fix adds the missing properties required by the Response interface and uses as unknown as Response for a safer type cast. This approach:

Adds missing properties: Includes redirected, type, url, clone, body, bodyUsed, and the other response methods
Uses safer casting: The as unknown as Response pattern is TypeScript's recommended way to cast between incompatible types
Maintains test functionality: The mock still provides the essential methods (arrayBuffer) that your tests actually use
The mock Response objects now have all the required properties, even if some are just mock functions that won't be called in your tests. This satisfies TypeScript's type checking while keeping your test functionality intact.
