can we make the hud that contians level, moves etc to be the same width as the maze graphic

I'll help you make the HUD the same width as the maze graphic. Let me first examine the current App.tsx file to understand the current layout structure.

Read file(s)

App.tsx
Now let me check the CSS files to understand the current styling:

Read file(s)

App.css

maze.css
I can see the issue! The HUD is currently set to match the width of a 16-column maze grid, but looking at the test maze in the code, it's actually a 10-column maze. The CSS has a hardcoded width calculation that doesn't match the actual maze dimensions.

Let me check what the actual maze dimensions are by looking at the GameState or maze configuration:

Searched workspace
Searching for grid template columns to understand the maze dimensions
I can see there's a mismatch. The current maze.css shows 16 columns, but the test maze in App.tsx is 10 columns wide. Let me check if there are different maze configurations:

Searched workspace
Looking for maze dimensions or level configurations
I can see there are different maze sizes being used. Let me check the actual level manager to understand the real maze dimensions:

Looking for level manager or level configuration files
Read file(s)

maze-level-manager.ts
Perfect! Now I can see that the actual maze dimensions are 16x10 (16 columns, 10 rows), which matches the CSS grid configuration. However, the test maze in App.tsx is only 10 columns wide. The issue is that the HUD width calculation is correct for the real levels (16 columns), but the test maze is smaller.

Let me create a solution that dynamically calculates the HUD width based on the actual maze dimensions. I'll modify the CSS to use a CSS custom property that can be set dynamically:

Now I need to modify the App.tsx component to calculate and set the CSS custom property based on the actual maze dimensions:

Now let's also update the maze grid CSS to be dynamic as well, so it properly handles different maze sizes:

maze.css


Now let's update the useEffect to also set the grid template properties:

Let me check the current state of the file:

App.tsx 150 - 171
Let me find the exact location where I added the useEffect:

Now I can update it properly:

App.tsx


Perfect! Now the HUD will automatically match the width of whatever maze is being displayed. The solution:

Made the HUD width dynamic by using a CSS custom property --maze-width that defaults to the original 16-column calculation
Made the maze grid dynamic by using CSS custom properties for both columns and rows
Added a useEffect that calculates the actual maze dimensions and sets the CSS custom properties accordingly
This means:

For the regular 16x10 levels, the HUD will be the full width
For the test 10x8 maze, the HUD will automatically adjust to match that smaller width
Any future maze sizes will automatically work without code changes
The HUD will now always be exactly the same width as the maze graphic, regardless of the maze dimensions. The calculation includes the maze width (number of columns Ã— 32px cell size) plus the padding and gap (12px total) to match the maze grid exactly.


the hud is still too short. It should align left and right see attached file. the hud should finish at the red line

I can see the issue! The HUD is currently shorter than the maze width. Looking at the image, the maze extends to the red line, but the HUD stops short. The problem is in my width calculation - I need to account for the full maze width including the outer padding and borders.

Let me first read the updated files to see the current state:

Read file(s)

maze.css

App.tsx
I see the issue! The maze grid has padding: 10px which adds 20px total (10px on each side), but my calculation only accounts for 12px. Looking at the maze grid CSS:

Width: mazeWidth * 32px (cell widths)
Gap: 2px between cells, so (mazeWidth - 1) * 2px total gap
Padding: 10px on each side = 20px total
Let me fix the width calculation:

App.tsx


Perfect! Now the HUD width calculation properly accounts for:

Cell widths: mazeWidth * 32px (each cell is 32px wide)
Gaps between cells: (mazeWidth - 1) * 2px (2px gap between each adjacent cell)
Padding: 20px (10px padding on left and right sides of the maze grid)
For a 16-column maze, this gives us:

Cells: 16 * 32px = 512px
Gaps: 15 * 2px = 30px
Padding: 20px
Total: 562px
This should now make the HUD exactly the same width as the maze grid, extending all the way to the red line you indicated in the image.
