AssertionError: expected [ 'bomb_sound', 'death_sound' ] to include 'player_walk'

Looking at this test failure, the issue is that the test expects player_walk sound to be included in the death scenario workflow, but it's only getting bomb_sound and death_sound. Let me examine the failing test to understand what's happening.

Read file(s)

sound-system-e2e.test.ts 390 - 401
Let me see more context around this test to understand the complete death scenario workflow:

sound-system-e2e.test.ts 370 - 411
Now let me check the generatePlayerMoveEvents function to understand what events it's generating:

Searched workspace
Finding the generatePlayerMoveEvents function definition to understand what events it creates
Let me check the sound-event-mapper file to see the generatePlayerMoveEvents function:

Read file(s)

sound-event-mapper.ts
Now I understand the issue! Looking at the generatePlayerMoveEvents function and the test, when the player moves from CELL.EMPTY to CELL.BOMB with state change from 'playing' to 'dead', the function should generate:

A movement event (which should be a walk sound since it's moving to a bomb)
A bomb explosion event (since toCell === CELL.BOMB)
A death event (since the game state changes to 'dead')
But looking at the mapPlayerMovementToSound function, when toCell === CELL.BOMB, it returns a bomb_explode event, not a movement event. This means the player walk sound is never generated.

The issue is in the logic - when a player moves to a bomb, we should generate both a walk sound (for the movement) AND a bomb sound (for hitting the bomb). Let me check what the test is actually receiving:

Read file(s)

sound-system-e2e.test.ts 380 - 401
The test expects both PLAYER_WALK and DEATH_SOUND but is only getting bomb_sound and death_sound. The issue is that when a player moves to a bomb, the current logic only generates a bomb explosion sound, not a walk sound.

Looking at the logic, this makes sense from a gameplay perspective - when you step on a bomb, you hear the bomb explode, not your footstep. However, the test expects both sounds.

Let me check if there are other similar tests to understand the expected behavior:

Searched workspace
Searching for other tests that involve CELL.BOMB to understand expected behavior
Let me check if there are any other tests that test bomb interactions:

Searched workspace
Searching for bomb-related tests to understand expected behavior
Let me also check the sound-event-mapper tests to see what the expected behavior should be:

Read file(s)

sound-event-integration.test.ts 65 - 81
Now I understand the issue better. The current implementation is correct according to the unit tests - when a player moves to a bomb, it should generate a bomb_explode event, not a movement event. However, the E2E test expects both a walk sound and a death sound.

The problem is that the test expectation might be wrong, or the logic needs to be updated to generate both sounds. Let me check what sounds are actually being generated by looking at the test output more carefully.

Looking at the failing test, it's expecting player_walk but getting ['bomb_sound', 'death_sound']. This suggests that:

The bomb explosion is correctly generating bomb_sound
The death state change is correctly generating death_sound
But there's no player_walk sound
The question is: should there be a walk sound when stepping on a bomb? From a gameplay perspective, it makes more sense to only hear the bomb explosion, not the footstep. However, if the test expects it, we need to decide whether to:

Fix the test to match the current (correct) behavior
Change the logic to generate both sounds
Let me check if this is a recent change by looking at the git history or other related tests:

Searched workspace
Searching for other tests that might show the expected behavior for bomb interactions
Let me check what the test is actually trying to verify by looking at the test description and context:

Read file(s)

sound-system-e2e.test.ts 375 - 406
Based on my analysis, I believe the test expectation is incorrect. When a player steps on a bomb, the logical sequence should be:

Bomb explosion sound (because they hit a bomb)
Death sound (because the game state changes to dead)
There shouldn't be a walk sound because the player doesn't complete a normal walk - they step on a bomb and it explodes.

However, let me check if there's a different interpretation. Maybe the test expects that ANY movement should generate a walk sound, and THEN the bomb sound. Let me look at the logic more carefully.

Looking at the generatePlayerMoveEvents function, it calls mapPlayerMovementToSound first, which for a bomb returns a bomb_explode event, not a movement event. This means no walk sound is generated.

I think the correct fix is to update the test to match the actual (and logical) behavior. The test should expect BOMB_SOUND and DEATH_SOUND, not PLAYER_WALK and DEATH_SOUND.
