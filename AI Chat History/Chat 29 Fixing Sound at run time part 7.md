## Analysis

I investigated the failing test and found the issue was with the mock setup in the test. The test was expecting 9 fetch calls but getting 24 calls due to improper mock configuration.

### Root Cause
The test was using `mockRejectedValueOnce` for the first call and `mockResolvedValue` for subsequent calls, but the mock response object was missing proper `headers` property with an `entries()` method, causing errors and excessive retries.

### Investigation Process

1. **Examined the test file** to understand the test setup and expectations
2. **Analyzed the sound configuration** to confirm there are 9 sounds total with 8 unique URLs (VICTORY_SOUND and DOOR_SLAM share the same URL)
3. **Reviewed the AssetLoader implementation** to understand URL caching and retry logic
4. **Ran the failing test** to see the actual behavior and error messages
5. **Identified the mock issue** at line 174 in asset-loader.ts where `response.headers.entries()` was failing

### The Fix

Updated the test mock to include proper response structure:

```typescript
it('should retry failed loads', async () => {
    mockFetch
        .mockRejectedValueOnce(new Error('Network error'))
        .mockResolvedValue({
            ok: true,
            status: 200,
            statusText: 'OK',
            headers: new Map([['content-type', 'audio/mpeg']]),
            arrayBuffer: () => Promise.resolve(mockArrayBuffer)
        });

    await manager.preloadSounds();

    // Should have retried and eventually succeeded for all sounds
    // First call fails, then all subsequent calls succeed
    // Note: With URL caching, duplicate URLs (VICTORY_SOUND and DOOR_SLAM) share requests
    // The first call to walk.mp3 fails, then retries and succeeds
    // All other sounds succeed on first try
    // So we expect: 8 unique URLs + 1 retry for walk.mp3 = 9 total calls
    expect(mockFetch).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(9); // 8 unique URLs + 1 retry
});
```

### Key Changes
- Added proper `status` and `statusText` properties
- Fixed `headers` to be a proper Map with `entries()` method
- Updated comments to clarify the expected behavior

### Test Results
After the fix, the test now passes successfully:
- ✓ Enhanced Audio Manager > WebAudioManager > error recovery > should retry failed loads (1089ms)
- All 9 sounds load successfully after the retry
- Fetch is called exactly 9 times as expected

The fix ensures the mock response object properly mimics a real fetch Response object, preventing the "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'entries')" error that was causing excessive retries.
