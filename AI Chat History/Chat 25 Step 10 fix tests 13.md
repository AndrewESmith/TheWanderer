# TypeScript Development Standards

You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Vite, React, and modern web development, with a deep understanding of best practices and performance optimization techniques.

## Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, maintainable, and technically accurate TypeScript code with relevant examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Favor iteration and modularization to adhere to DRY principles and avoid code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Organize files systematically: each file should contain only related content, such as exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types

## Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard)
- Favor named exports for functions

## TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types for their extendability and ability to merge
- Avoid enums; use maps instead for better type safety and flexibility
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces

## Syntax and Formatting
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions to benefit from hoisting and clarity
- Always use modern React patterns with hooks and functional components

## UI and Styling
- Implement responsive design with CSS; use a mobile-first approach
- Use CSS modules or styled-components for component styling

## Performance Optimization
- Wrap asynchronous components in Suspense with a fallback UI
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading
- Implement an optimized chunking strategy during the Vite build process, such as code splitting, to generate smaller bundle sizes

## Key Conventions
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID) using tools like Lighthouse or WebPageTest
- Write clean, testable code with proper error handling
- Use meaningful commit messages and maintain clean git history

## Analysis

I can see there's a failing test related to error handling in the audio manager. Let me examine the test file and the current audio manager implementation to understand what's going wrong.

The test is expecting the `playSound` method to call `console.error` with the message "Play error for test_sound:" when an error occurs during playback, but looking at the current implementation, the error handling is done through the `handlePlayError` method which logs a different format.

Let me look at the `handlePlayError` method more closely and see how it's being called in the `playSound` method.

Perfect! I can see the issue now. The `handlePlayError` method is correctly implemented and should log the expected message format, but let me check if there's an issue with how it's being called in the `playSound` method.

Now I can see the issue! The test is mocking `createBufferSource` to throw an error, but the error is being thrown at the line:

```typescript
const source = this.state.audioContext.createBufferSource();
```

This should be caught by the try-catch block and handled by `handlePlayError`, which should log the expected message. Let me run the test to see what's actually happening.

I can see the issue now! The test output shows:

```
stderr | src/tests/audio-manager.test.ts > Audio Manager > Error Handling > should handle playback errors gracefully
Invalid buffer for test_sound test_sound
```

The problem is that the code is hitting the buffer validation check before it gets to the `createBufferSource()` call. The test is setting up a mock buffer, but the `isValidBuffer` method is rejecting it because it doesn't have the proper properties.

Now I understand the issue! The test is creating a mock buffer with only `length` and `sampleRate` properties:

```typescript
(manager as any).state.soundBuffers.set('test_sound', {
    length: 1000,
    sampleRate: 44100
});
```

But the `isValidBuffer` method requires `numberOfChannels` and `duration` properties as well. The buffer fails validation and the method returns early with a `console.warn`, never reaching the `createBufferSource()` call that would throw the error.

I need to fix the test to provide a proper mock buffer that passes validation. Let me update the test:

## Fix Applied

The string appears multiple times. Let me be more specific by including more context:

```typescript
// Mock audio context to throw during source creation
const mockContext = (manager as any).state.audioContext;
if (mockContext) {
    mockContext.createBufferSource = vi.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
        throw new Error('Source creation failed');
    });
}

// Mock that sound is loaded
(manager as any).state.soundBuffers.set('test_sound', {
    length: 1000,
    sampleRate: 44100,
    numberOfChannels: 2,
    duration: 1.0
});
```

Now let's run the test to see if it passes.

Perfect! The test is now passing. Let's run all the audio manager tests to make sure I didn't break anything else.

Excellent! All tests are now passing, including the one we fixed. The test output shows:

```
✓ Audio Manager > Error Handling > should handle playback errors gracefully 2ms
```

Perfect! The fix worked. Let me also check if there are any other tests that might have similar issues with incomplete mock buffers. I noticed some stderr messages about "Invalid buffer" in other tests.

I can see there are other tests with the same incomplete mock buffer issue. Let me fix those as well:

Now let me fix all three of these incomplete mock buffers:

```typescript
// Fix 1: should play sound with default options
it('should play sound with default options', () => {
    const manager = new WebAudioManager();

    // Mock that sound is loaded
    (manager as any).state.soundBuffers.set('test_sound', {
        length: 1000,
        sampleRate: 44100,
        numberOfChannels: 2,
        duration: 1.0
    });
```

```typescript
// Fix 2: should play sound with custom options
it('should play sound with custom options', () => {
    const manager = new WebAudioManager();

    // Mock that sound is loaded
    (manager as any).state.soundBuffers.set('test_sound', {
        length: 1000,
        sampleRate: 44100,
        numberOfChannels: 2,
        duration: 1.0
    });
```

```typescript
// Fix 3: should not play sound when muted
it('should not play sound when muted', () => {
    const manager = new WebAudioManager();
    manager.setMuted(true);

    // Mock that sound is loaded
    (manager as any).state.soundBuffers.set('test_sound', {
        length: 1000,
        sampleRate: 44100,
        numberOfChannels: 2,
        duration: 1.0
    });
```

Now let's run the tests again to make sure all the "Invalid buffer" warnings are gone.

Perfect! All tests are now passing, and I can see that the "Invalid buffer" warnings are gone from the stderr output. The tests now run cleanly without those buffer validation warnings.

## Summary

I successfully fixed the failing test "should handle playback errors gracefully" by identifying and resolving the root cause:

**The Problem:**
The test was expecting the `playSound` method to call `console.error` with "Play error for test_sound:" when an error occurred during playback. However, the test was failing because the mock audio buffer was incomplete and didn't pass the `isValidBuffer` validation.

**The Root Cause:**
The mock buffer in the test only had `length` and `sampleRate` properties:
```typescript
{
    length: 1000,
    sampleRate: 44100
}
```

But the `isValidBuffer` method requires all of these properties:
- `length > 0`
- `sampleRate > 0` 
- `numberOfChannels > 0`
- `duration > 0`

**The Solution:**
I updated the mock buffer to include all required properties:
```typescript
{
    length: 1000,
    sampleRate: 44100,
    numberOfChannels: 2,
    duration: 1.0
}
```

**Additional Fixes:**
I also found and fixed three other tests that had the same incomplete mock buffer issue:
- "should play sound with default options"
- "should play sound with custom options" 
- "should not play sound when muted"

**Result:**
All 27 tests in the audio manager test suite now pass, and the "Invalid buffer" warnings have been eliminated from the test output. The error handling test now properly exercises the intended code path where `createBufferSource()` throws an error, which gets caught and handled by the `handlePlayError` method.

You're absolutely right! The test is failing because the mock buffer doesn't have all the required properties for `isValidBuffer`. Let me find the specific test and fix it by providing a complete mock buffer.

The problem is that the mock buffer is missing `numberOfChannels` and `duration` properties. Let me fix this:

Perfect! Now I can see the exact issue. The mock buffer is missing `numberOfChannels` and `duration` properties. Let me fix this by updating the mock buffer to include all required properties for validation.

Now let's run the test to see if it passes and verify that all tests are working correctly.

Perfect! The test is now passing. Let's run all the audio manager tests to make sure I didn't break anything else and that all the "Invalid buffer" warnings are gone.
