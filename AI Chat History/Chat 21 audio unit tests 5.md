## Analysis and Solution

I analyzed the test failure and found that the issue was with the "should handle playback errors gracefully" test. The error showed that a mock was throwing an error when `createBufferSource` is called, but the test expects this error to be handled gracefully.

### Root Cause
The test was failing because the `console.error` call in the `createAudioSource` method was being treated as a test failure, even though the error was properly caught and handled.

### Investigation Process

1. **Examined the failing test**: The test mocks `createBufferSource` to throw an error and expects `playSound` to not throw.

2. **Analyzed the audio manager implementation**: Found that `createAudioSource` properly catches errors and logs them with `console.error`, then returns `null`.

3. **Identified the issue**: The `console.error` output was being treated as a test failure by the test runner.

### Solution Implementation

I fixed the test by adding proper console mocking:

```typescript
it('should handle playback errors gracefully', () => {
    const manager = new WebAudioManager();

    // Mock console.error to suppress error output during test
    const consoleErrorSpy = vi.spyOn(console, 'error').mockImplementation(() => {});

    // Mock audio context to throw during source creation
    const mockContext = (manager as any).state.audioContext;
    if (mockContext) {
        mockContext.createBufferSource = vi.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
            throw new Error('Source creation failed');
        });
    }

    // Mock that sound is loaded
    (manager as any).state.soundBuffers.set('test_sound', {
        length: 1000,
        sampleRate: 44100
    });

    // Should not throw
    expect(() => manager.playSound('test_sound')).not.toThrow();

    // Verify that error was logged
    expect(consoleErrorSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith('Failed to create audio source:', expect.any(Error));

    // Restore console.error
    consoleErrorSpy.mockRestore();
});
```

### Key Changes Made

1. **Added console.error spy**: Mocks `console.error` to suppress error output during test
2. **Verified error logging**: Ensures the error was properly logged with the expected message
3. **Restored console.error**: Cleans up the mock after the test

### Test Results

After implementing the fix:
- The specific failing test now passes
- All 27 audio manager tests pass successfully
- No regressions in existing functionality
- Error handling behavior is properly validated

### Benefits of the Fix

1. **Proper error handling validation**: The test now correctly validates that errors are handled gracefully
2. **Clean test output**: Console errors don't interfere with test execution
3. **Comprehensive verification**: Both the non-throwing behavior and error logging are verified
4. **Maintained functionality**: All existing error handling behavior remains intact

The fix ensures that when `createBufferSource` throws an error, the audio manager:
- Catches the error in `createAudioSource`
- Logs it appropriately with `console.error`
- Returns `null` from `createAudioSource`
- Handles the `null` return value gracefully in `playSound`
- Does not throw any unhandled exceptions

This maintains robust error handling while ensuring the test suite runs cleanly.
