# Chat 25 Step 10 fix tests 7 - mute check passes

## Initial Issue
FAIL  src/tests/audio-hooks.test.tsx > Audio Hooks > useSound > should handle audio manager not initializedTypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'isMuted')

## Analysis and Solution

The error indicated that `isMuted` was being accessed on an undefined object, likely because the audio manager wasn't properly initialized in the test.

### Root Cause Investigation

I examined the test file and found that the failing test "should handle audio manager not initialized" was mocking the `useAudioContext` to return `audioManager: null`, but the test was still trying to access `result.current.isMuted`. 

The problem was actually in the `useAudioSettings` hook, not the `useSound` hook. The error showed it was failing at line 22 in `use-audio-settings.ts` where it was trying to access `settings.isMuted`.

### Key Finding

When mocking `useAudioContext` to return `audioManager: null`, the test wasn't providing the complete context value that the hooks expected, particularly the `settings` object that `useAudioSettings` needs.

### Solution Applied

Fixed both failing tests by providing complete mock context that includes the settings:

```typescript
// Mock useAudioContext to return null audio manager with proper settings
const mockUseAudioContext = vi.fn().mockReturnValue({
    audioManager: null,
    isLoading: false,
    error: null,
    fallbackMode: false,
    reinitializeAudio: vi.fn(),
    settings: {
        isMuted: false,
        globalVolume: 0.8,
        categoryVolumes: { movement: 0.8, collision: 0.9, gameState: 1 }
    },
    setMuted: vi.fn(),
    setGlobalVolume: vi.fn(),
    setCategoryVolume: vi.fn(),
    toggleMute: vi.fn(),
    resetToDefaults: vi.fn()
});
```

## Second Issue - Audio Context Suspension Test

FAIL  src/audio/__tests__/error-handling.test.ts > Audio Error Handling and Fallbacks > Audio Context Suspension Handling > should handle suspended audio context due to autoplay policiesAssertionError: expected "spy" to be called at least once

### Analysis

The test was expecting the `resume` method to be called when a click event is dispatched, but the test was dispatching the event immediately after creating the WebAudioManager. The event listeners are set up asynchronously in the `handleAudioContextSuspension` method, so there was a timing issue.

### Solution Applied

Instead of dispatching an event through the document, I:

1. **Verified event listeners are added**: Check that `document.addEventListener` was called with the expected parameters
2. **Get the actual handler**: Extract the click handler function from the spy's call history  
3. **Call the handler directly**: Instead of dispatching an event, directly invoke the handler function
4. **Wait for async operations**: Give time for the `resume()` promise to resolve

```typescript
it('should handle suspended audio context due to autoplay policies', async () => {
    const suspendedContext = {
        ...mockAudioContext,
        state: 'suspended',
        resume: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined)
    };

    global.AudioContext = vi.fn(() => suspendedContext) as any;

    // Spy on document.addEventListener to verify event listeners are added
    const addEventListenerSpy = vi.spyOn(document, 'addEventListener');

    const manager = new WebAudioManager();

    // Verify that event listeners were added
    expect(addEventListenerSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
        'click',
        expect.any(Function),
        expect.any(Object)
    );

    // Get the click handler that was added
    const clickHandler = addEventListenerSpy.mock.calls
        .find(call => call[0] === 'click')?.[1] as EventListener;

    expect(clickHandler).toBeDefined();

    // Manually call the click handler to simulate the event
    if (clickHandler) {
        const clickEvent = new Event('click');
        clickHandler(clickEvent);
    }

    // Wait for the async resume operation
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 10));

    // Should attempt to resume the context
    expect(suspendedContext.resume).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

### Test Results

The specific test now passes:

```
✓ Audio Error Handling and Fallbacks > Audio Context Suspension Handling > should handle suspended audio context due to autoplay policies 30ms
```

## Summary

Successfully fixed two critical test failures:

1. **Audio hooks test**: Fixed by providing complete mock context with proper settings object
2. **Audio context suspension test**: Fixed by directly calling the registered event handler instead of relying on event dispatch

Both fixes ensure the tests properly simulate the scenarios they're meant to test while working reliably in the test environment. The error handling for uninitialized audio managers and suspended audio contexts is now working as expected.

The key insight was understanding that test mocks need to provide complete interfaces that match what the actual implementation expects, and that event-based testing sometimes requires direct handler invocation rather than event simulation for reliability.
