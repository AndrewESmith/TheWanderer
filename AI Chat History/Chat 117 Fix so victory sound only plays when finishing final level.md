Boulders no longer fall until they hit something. Boulder movement has been implemented however when play testing the Acceptance Criteria for requirement 1.4 4. WHEN a boulder is moving THEN it SHALL continue moving downward until it collides with another object is failing. Investigate the boulder movement implementation to understand why it's only moving one space instead of continuing until collision as per requirement. Please retify and add comments to codes and tests to ensure that this behaviour is not removed again in future updates
