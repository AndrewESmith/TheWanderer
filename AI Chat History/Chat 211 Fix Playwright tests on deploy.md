When I deploy and Playwright tests run I get this error "  1) [chromium] › src/playwrighttests/how-to-play-user-workflows.spec.ts:377:9 › How to Play User Workflows E2E › Accessibility and Keyboard Navigation › should support keyboard navigation

I can see you're having a Playwright test failure where a checkbox isn't getting focused as expected. Let me examine the test file to understand the issue better.

Read file(s)

how-to-play-user-workflows.spec.ts
Now let me look at the specific area around line 398 where the test is failing:

The issue is that the test expects the checkbox to be focused after pressing Tab three times, but it's not getting focus. This could be due to:

The tab order might have changed
There might be additional focusable elements in the DOM
The checkbox might not be properly focusable
Let me check the actual component to understand the structure:

Searched workspace
Finding the checkbox component to understand its implementation
Let me check the actual HowToPlayPopup component to understand the structure:

Read file(s)

HowToPlayPopup.tsx
Now let me check the HowToPlayContent component to see what links are in there:

Read file(s)

HowToPlayContent.tsx
Now I understand the issue. Looking at the DOM structure, the focusable elements in order are:

Close button (header)
Andrew Smith link (LinkedIn)
Wanderer link (Wikipedia)
Steven Shipway link
Checkbox
Close footer button
The test assumes that after tabbing 3 times from the Andrew Smith link, it will reach the checkbox. But the test is currently failing because the focus order might be different than expected.

Let me create a more robust test that doesn't rely on hardcoded tab counts:

The issue might also be that the checkbox isn't properly focusable. Let me check if there are any CSS issues that might prevent focus:

Read file(s)

HowToPlayPopup.css
I can see the issue! The checkbox has position: absolute; opacity: 0; which makes it invisible but still focusable. However, the focus styles are applied to the parent .dont-show-again-toggle:focus-within. The test might be failing because the checkbox itself isn't visually focused, even though it has focus.

Let me also check if there might be timing issues. Let me create a more robust test that waits for focus and handles potential timing issues:
