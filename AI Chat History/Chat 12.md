# Chat 12: Handling Node.js Punycode Deprecation Warning and Test Setup

## User
running unit tests is returning the message (node:28136) [DEP0040] DeprecationWarning: The `punycode` module is deprecated. Please use a userland alternative instead.(Use `node.EXE --trace-deprecation ...` to show where the warning was created)

## Assistant
I see you're encountering a deprecation warning about the `punycode` module when running unit tests. This is a common warning in newer Node.js versions as the `punycode` module has been deprecated.

Let's examine your test configuration files to understand how to address this issue:

The `punycode` deprecation warning you're seeing is a Node.js internal warning that doesn't affect the functionality of your tests. This module is likely being used by one of your dependencies.

Here are a few ways to address this:

1. **Suppress the warning** (simplest approach):

Let's create a script that will run your tests with the deprecation warnings suppressed:

Now you have a few options to run your tests without seeing the punycode deprecation warning:

1. Run `npm run test:no-warnings` - This will run your tests with warnings suppressed
2. Run the batch file `run-tests-no-warnings.bat` - This will set the environment variable and run tests
3. Manually set the environment variable before running tests:
   ```
   set NODE_NO_WARNINGS=1
   npm test
   ```

The warning about the punycode module is just informational and doesn't affect your test functionality. It's coming from Node.js itself as they're planning to remove this module in future versions. Some of your dependencies (likely in the testing framework or React ecosystem) are still using this deprecated module.

Would you like me to help with anything else regarding your tests or this warning?

## User
when I run npm start it want unit tests to run with NODE_NO_WARNINGS=1 how do I do that?

## Assistant
I see you want to run your development server (`npm start`) with the `NODE_NO_WARNINGS=1` environment variable to suppress the punycode deprecation warnings. Let's set this up for you.

Since you're on Windows, there are a few ways to do this:

### Option 1: Update your package.json start script

Let's modify your package.json to include the environment variable in your start script:

I notice we need to add the `cross-env` package as a dev dependency since it's being used in the test:no-warnings script but isn't in your dependencies. Let's install it first and then update the start script:

Now you have three options to run your application without seeing the punycode deprecation warnings:

1. Simply run `npm start` or `npm run dev` - I've updated these scripts in package.json to use cross-env to set the NODE_NO_WARNINGS environment variable.

2. Run the batch file `start-no-warnings.bat` - This will set the environment variable and start your development server.

3. Set the environment variable manually in your terminal before running npm start:
   ```
   set NODE_NO_WARNINGS=1
   npm start
   ```

The first option is the most convenient as it's built into your npm scripts now. You can just use your normal workflow and the warnings will be suppressed.

## User
when I enter npm start in the terminal can you confirm that unit tests are run ?

## Assistant
Based on my examination of your project configuration and the output from running `npm start`, I can confirm that:

**Unit tests are NOT run when you execute `npm start`.**

Here's what happens when you run `npm start`:

1. The `start` script in your package.json runs: `cross-env NODE_NO_WARNINGS=1 vite --mode development`
2. This starts the Vite development server with the NODE_NO_WARNINGS environment variable set to suppress deprecation warnings
3. The server starts on port 3000 as configured in your vite.config.js
4. No tests are executed as part of this process

Your unit tests are only run when you explicitly execute one of these commands:
- `npm test` - Runs tests once using vitest
- `npm run test:watch` - Runs tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:isolated` - Runs tests using the custom run-tests.js script
- `npm run test:no-warnings` - Runs tests with warnings suppressed

If you want to run tests automatically when starting your development server, you would need to modify your start script to include test execution. Would you like me to show you how to do that?

## User
yes please

## Assistant
I'll show you how to modify your setup to run tests automatically when starting your development server. Let's create a custom script that will run your tests first and then start the development server.

Here's how we'll do it:

1. First, let's create a new script file that will run tests and then start the development server:

2. Now, let's update your package.json to include a new script that uses this file:

3. Let's also create a Windows batch file for convenience:

4. For completeness, let's also create a PowerShell script version:

Now you have multiple ways to start your development server with tests running first:

1. **Using npm script:**
   ```
   npm run start:with-tests
   ```

2. **Using the batch file:**
   ```
   start-with-tests.bat
   ```

3. **Using the PowerShell script:**
   ```
   .\start-with-tests.ps1
   ```

The script will:
1. Run your tests with warnings suppressed
2. If tests pass, start the development server
3. If tests fail, show the error and exit without starting the server

This approach ensures that your development server only starts if all tests are passing, which can help catch issues early.

If you want to make this the default behavior when running `npm start`, you can update your package.json to replace the current start script:

Now when you run `npm start`, it will automatically run tests first and then start the development server if tests pass. If you ever need to start the server without running tests, you can use `npm run start:no-tests`.

Would you like to test this setup to make sure it works as expected?

## User
yes

## Assistant
Great! The setup is working perfectly. When you run `npm start`, the following happens:

1. The tests run first (with NODE_NO_WARNINGS=1 set to suppress deprecation warnings)
2. All 3 tests in `src/tests/GameState.test.ts` passed successfully
3. After the tests complete successfully, the development server starts
4. The Vite server is now running on http://localhost:3000/

Let's also test the `start:no-tests` script to make sure it works correctly if you ever need to start the server without running tests:

Perfect! Both scripts are working as expected:

1. `npm start` - Runs tests first and then starts the development server if tests pass
2. `npm run start:no-tests` - Starts the development server directly without running tests

You now have a complete setup that:

1. Runs your tests automatically before starting the development server
2. Suppresses the punycode deprecation warnings
3. Provides flexibility with different start options

To summarize your available commands:

- `npm start` - Run tests first, then start the development server (if tests pass)
- `npm run start:no-tests` - Start the development server without running tests
- `npm test` - Run tests once
- `npm run test:no-warnings` - Run tests with warnings suppressed
- `start-with-tests.bat` - Windows batch file to run tests and start the server
- `start-with-tests.ps1` - PowerShell script to run tests and start the server

Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with regarding your test setup or development environment?
