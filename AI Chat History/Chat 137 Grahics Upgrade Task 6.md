Execute Task: 6. Create unit tests for image system 6. Create unit tests for image system

I'll implement task 6 to create unit tests for the image system. Let me start by updating the task status and then examining the current test structure.

Task: 6. Create unit tests for image system from 
tasks.md
Status: In Progress
Let me examine the current test structure and the relevant source files to understand what needs to be tested.

Read file(s)

maze.ts

App.tsx
Now let me check the existing test structure to understand the testing patterns used in this project.

Searched workspace
Examining the test directory structure to understand existing test patterns
Let me check the test setup and mocks to understand the testing environment:

Read file(s)

setup.ts

vitest-setup.ts
Let me also check the mocks directory to see what's already available:

Searched workspace
Checking existing mocks to understand what's available for testing
Now let me check an existing React component test to understand the testing patterns:

Read file(s)

app-sound-integration-comprehensive.test.tsx 1 - 51
Now I'll create comprehensive unit tests for the image system. Based on the task requirements, I need to test:

The updated ICONS constant to verify correct image paths
Cell component rendering with image backgrounds
Mock image loading scenarios to test error handling
Created

image-system.test.tsx


Now let me run the tests to make sure they work correctly:

I need to fix the test - toEndWith is not a valid Vitest/Chai matcher. Let me fix this:

Excellent! All tests are now passing. Let me also create a more comprehensive test that specifically tests the image retry logic and error handling that's implemented in the actual App component:

Excellent! All tests are passing. Now let me update the task status to completed and provide a summary of what was implemented:

Task: 6. Create unit tests for image system from 
tasks.md
Status: Completed
Task 6 Complete: Unit Tests for Image System
I've successfully implemented comprehensive unit tests for the image system as specified in the task requirements. Here's what was created:

Test Files Created:
src/tests/image-system.test.tsx - Main test suite covering:

ICONS constant validation: Tests verify correct PNG image paths, proper file extensions, and mapping to CELL constants
Cell component rendering: Tests image background application, CSS class handling, and loading states
Error handling: Tests graceful degradation when images fail to load
Image preloading system: Tests the preloading functionality with success and error scenarios
src/tests/image-loading-retry.test.tsx - Advanced retry logic tests covering:

Retry mechanism: Tests the retry logic for failed image loads
Timeout handling: Tests scenarios where images never trigger load/error events
Detailed error logging: Tests comprehensive error information collection
Mixed scenarios: Tests combinations of successful and failed image loads
Key Test Coverage:
✅ ICONS Constant Tests (Requirements 3.2):

Validates all PNG image paths are correctly formatted
Ensures paths start with "/" for public folder access
Confirms PNG file extensions
Verifies mapping to CELL constant values
✅ Cell Component Tests (Requirements 3.2):

Tests CSS class application and styling
Validates background image rendering when images load successfully
Tests loading state management
Ensures all cell types render correctly
✅ Error Handling Tests (Requirements 4.1):

Tests graceful handling of image loading failures
Validates fallback behavior when images don't load
Tests error state CSS classes and titles
Ensures no background image is applied on failure
✅ Advanced Retry Logic Tests:

Tests exponential backoff retry mechanism
Validates timeout handling for unresponsive images
Tests detailed error logging with timestamps
Validates mixed success/failure scenarios
Test Results:
18 tests total - All passing ✅
13 tests in main image system suite
5 tests in retry logic suite
Comprehensive mocking of Image constructor and audio system
Proper cleanup and isolation between tests
The tests follow TypeScript standards with functional patterns, proper error handling, and comprehensive coverage of both happy path and error scenarios. They validate that the image system meets all requirements for consistent graphics display and robust error handling.
