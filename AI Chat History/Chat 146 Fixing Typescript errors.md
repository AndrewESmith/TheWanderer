Looking at the error, the issue is that handleGameEndSounds expects a parameter of type "dead" | "won", but you're passing newGameState which has the broader type "playing" | "dead" | "won".

The fix is simple - since you've already checked that this is an actual game end (not playing), you can safely cast or narrow the type. Here's the fix:

GameState.ts


The type assertion as 'dead' | 'won' is safe here because:

You've already verified isActualGameEnd is true
The logic for isActualGameEnd ensures newGameState is either 'dead' or 'won' (it checks for actual game endings, not just level completions)
The condition previousGameState === 'playing' confirms this is a state transition from playing to an end state
This tells TypeScript that at this point in the code, newGameState can only be 'dead' or 'won', which matches what handleGameEndSounds expects.

PerformanceMockImage.operationTimes.push({
  operation: "setSrc",

How do I fix the following problem in the above code?: Property 'operationTimes' is private and only accessible within class 'PerformanceMockImage'.

The issue is that you're trying to access the private static property operationTimes from within an extended class. In the mixed scenario test, you're creating a new class that extends PerformanceMockImage, but private members aren't accessible from subclasses.

Here's the fix - change the private static properties to protected static so they can be accessed by subclasses:

Now the subclass in the mixed scenario test can access operationTimes and other static properties. The protected access modifier allows access from within the class and its subclasses, but not from outside code, which maintains the encapsulation you want while fixing the compilation error.

The issue is that textContent() can return null, but you're using the nullish coalescing operator || which doesn't handle null properly in this context. The TypeScript compiler sees that textContent() returns string | null, and even with || '0', it's still considering the possibility of undefined.

Here's the fix - use the nullish coalescing operator ?? instead of ||:

Perfect! I've fixed all instances of the TypeScript error. The issue was that textContent() returns string | null, and using the logical OR operator || with a fallback string wasn't sufficient for TypeScript's strict null checks.

The nullish coalescing operator ?? is the correct choice here because:

It only provides the fallback value when the left side is null or undefined
It properly handles the string | null return type from textContent()
It ensures the extractNumber function always receives a string parameter
All the TypeScript errors should now be resolved.

Looking at the code, I can see that all the || operators have already been changed to ?? operators, which should have fixed the TypeScript error. However, you're still getting the error, which suggests there might be a TypeScript configuration issue or the error is persisting from a cached state.

Let me check if there are any remaining issues by looking at the extractNumber function and its usage:

Read file(s)

game-flow-e2e.spec.ts 340 - 346
The function signature looks correct. The issue might be that TypeScript is still seeing the old cached types. Let me verify that all the ?? operators are correctly applied by checking a specific line that was mentioned in the error:

Read file(s)

game-flow-e2e.spec.ts 40 - 51
The code looks correct with the ?? operator. This might be a TypeScript cache issue. Let me try a different approach - let's make the extractNumber function more robust by explicitly handling the null case:

Now let's update all the calls to extractNumber to pass the result directly without the nullish coalescing operator, since the function now handles null values:

Perfect! Now I've fixed the TypeScript error by:

Updated the extractNumber function to accept string | null instead of just string, since textContent() returns string | null
Added null checking inside the function to handle null values gracefully
Removed all the nullish coalescing operators (?? '0', ?? '1') from the function calls since the function now handles null values internally
This approach is cleaner and more robust because:

The function signature matches what textContent() actually returns
All null handling is centralized in one place
The calling code is simpler and more readable
TypeScript is satisfied that we're handling the null case properly
The TypeScript errors should now be completely resolved.

I can see the issue. Even though we updated the extractNumber function to accept string | null, TypeScript is still complaining because textContent() can actually return string | null, but the error message shows string | undefined. This suggests there might be a TypeScript configuration issue or version difference.

Let's make the function even more robust by accepting both null and undefined:

game-flow-e2e.spec.ts


This should resolve the TypeScript error completely. The function now accepts:

string - normal text content
null - when the element exists but has no text content
undefined - when the element doesn't exist or other edge cases
The if (!text) check handles all falsy values (null, undefined, empty string) gracefully, making the function very robust for handling DOM text content extraction.
