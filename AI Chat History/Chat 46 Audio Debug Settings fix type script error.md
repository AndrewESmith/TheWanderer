it("should display error when present", () => {
  mockUseSound.error = "Audio initialization failed";

  render(<AudioDebug />);
How do I fix the following problem in the above code?: Type '"Audio initialization failed"' is not assignable to type 'null'.

The issue is that mockUseSound.error is typed as null but you're trying to assign a string to it. You need to cast the mock object to allow for different types or modify the mock definition.

Here's the fix:

Alternatively, you could fix this more elegantly by updating the mock definition at the top to allow for both null and string types:

Now you can remove the any cast since the error property is properly typed:

The fix involved updating the mock object's error property to be typed as string | null instead of just null, which allows you to assign both null values and string error messages to it during testing.

it("should handle audio manager without state", () => {
  mockUseAudioContext.audioManager = { state: null };

  render(<AudioDebug />);
How do I fix the following problem in the above code?: Type 'null' is not assignable to type '{ audioContext: { state: string; }; loadedSounds: Set<string>; }'.

The issue is similar to the previous one - the state property in the mock is typed too strictly. You need to allow it to be null for testing edge cases. Here's the fix:

This allows the mock to be reassigned to different shapes during testing, including null values and objects with missing properties. The as any type assertion gives you the flexibility to test various edge cases without TypeScript complaining about type mismatches.

Now your test can properly assign null to the state property and test how the component handles missing or malformed audio manager states.
