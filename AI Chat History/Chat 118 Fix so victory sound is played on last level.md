I asked for the VICTORY_SOUND to only play when finishing the last level but I still hear it when exiting the first level. It should only play when I exit the final level

I need to investigate the current sound configuration and see how the VICTORY_SOUND is being triggered. Let me first examine the sound config file and then look at the game logic to understand when the victory sound is playing.

Read file(s)

sound-config.ts
Now I need to find where the VICTORY_SOUND is being triggered. Let me search for where this sound is played in the codebase.

Now let me search for where the victory event is triggered to understand the game logic:

Let me look at the level progression handler to understand when victory events are triggered:

Now let me look at the actual level progression handler implementation:

level-progression-handler.ts
Now let me check where this level progression handler is being used in the game logic:

Searching for where the level progression handler is used to understand when victory sounds are triggered
Perfect! Now I can see the issue. Looking at the GameState.ts file, I can see that the victory sound is being triggered whenever a level is completed, but the logic should only trigger the victory sound when completing the final level. Let me examine the GameState.ts file more closely:

Read file(s)

GameState.ts 260 - 291
I can see the logic is actually correct in GameState.ts. The victory sound should only play when progressionResult.isGameComplete is true, and the door slam sound should play when advancing to the next level. Let me check if there might be an issue in the level progression handler logic itself. Let me also check how many levels are configured:

Searched workspace
Searching for level configuration to understand how many levels exist
Let me check the maze level manager to see how many levels are configured:

Read file(s)

Let me continue reading to see all the levels:

maze-level-manager.ts 50 - 151
Let me continue reading to see the end of the level configuration:

Read file(s)

maze-level-manager.ts 150 - 281
Perfect! Now I understand the issue. The game has 5 levels (levels 1-5), and the victory sound should only play when completing level 5 (the final level). Let me run a test to see what's happening when I complete level 1:

The tests are passing, which means the logic is correct. Let me check if there might be another place where the victory sound is being triggered. Let me search for where the game end sound manager is used:

Searched workspace
Searching for game end sound manager usage to see if there's another place triggering victory sounds
Let me check the game-end-sound-manager to see if it's also triggering victory sounds:

Read file(s)

game-end-sound-manager.ts
Found it! The issue is in the game-end-sound-manager.ts. This manager is triggering a victory sound whenever the game state is 'won', regardless of whether it's the final level or not. Let me check where this is being called in GameState.ts:

Searched workspace
Searching for where handleGameEndSounds is called in GameState.ts
Now I can see the problem! In GameState.ts, line 187 is calling handleGameEndSounds(newGameState) whenever the game state changes from 'playing' to either 'dead' or 'won'. This happens on every level completion, not just the final level.

The issue is that there are two different sound systems:

The level progression handler (which correctly only plays victory sound on final level completion)
The game end sound manager (which plays victory sound on any level completion)
I need to modify the GameState.ts to only call handleGameEndSounds when the game is actually complete (final level), not just when a level is won. Let me examine the relevant section of GameState.ts:

Read file(s)

GameState.ts 180 - 201
Let me see more context around this section to understand the full logic:

Read file(s)

GameState.ts 180 - 301
Perfect! Now I can see the issue clearly. The problem is that handleGameEndSounds(newGameState) is being called on line 187 whenever the game state changes from 'playing' to 'won', which happens on every level completion. However, the level progression system correctly handles the sounds later in the code.

The fix is to modify the condition on line 186 to only call handleGameEndSounds when the game is actually ending (either death or final level completion), not just when a level is won.

Here's the fix:

Great! The tests are mostly passing. There's one failing test in game-state-sound-transitions.test.ts which is expected because my fix changed the behavior - the victory sound is no longer triggered by the game end sound manager for intermediate levels, which is exactly what we wanted.

Let me check that specific test to see if it needs to be updated:

Read file(s)

game-state-sound-transitions.test.ts 120 - 141
This test is expecting the old behavior where the game end sound manager would trigger victory sounds for any level completion. Since my fix changed this behavior to only trigger victory sounds for the final level, I need to update this test. Let me look at the full test to understand the context:

Read file(s)

game-state-sound-transitions.test.ts 100 - 151
I can see that this test is using a custom 3x3 maze, which means it's not using the level system (which requires 16x10 mazes). Since my fix only affects the level system behavior, this test should still work for custom mazes. However, the test is failing because it's expecting the game end sound manager to be called, but my fix prevents that for non-final levels.

Let me check if this custom maze would be considered as having a "next level" available:

Read file(s)

game-state-sound-transitions.test.ts 1 - 51
I see the issue. The test is using createInitialGameState which creates a game state with the default level manager. Since the custom maze is 3x3 (not 16x10), my condition gameState.maze.length === 10 && gameState.maze[0]?.length === 16 will be false, so it won't use the level system. However, the level manager still has next levels available, so !gameState.levelManager.hasNextLevel() will also be false.

This means the condition isActualGameEnd will be false, so the game end sound manager won't be called. But for custom mazes that aren't part of the level system, we should still allow the victory sound to play.

Let me fix this by updating the condition to handle custom mazes properly:

Excellent! All tests are passing. Let me create a summary of what I've accomplished:

Summary
I successfully fixed the issue where the VICTORY_SOUND was playing when exiting the first level instead of only playing when exiting the final level. Here's what I did:

Problem Analysis
The issue was caused by two different sound systems both triggering victory sounds:

Level Progression Handler - Correctly only played victory sound on final level completion
Game End Sound Manager - Incorrectly played victory sound on ANY level completion
Solution
I modified the GameState.ts file to change when the handleGameEndSounds function is called. The key change was in the condition that determines when a game has actually ended:

Before:

if (newGameState !== 'playing' && previousGameState === 'playing') {
    handleGameEndSounds(newGameState);
After:

const isActualGameEnd = newGameState === 'dead' ||
    (newGameState === 'won' && (gameState.maze.length !== 10 || gameState.maze[0]?.length !== 16 || !gameState.levelManager.hasNextLevel()));

if (isActualGameEnd && previousGameState === 'playing') {
    handleGameEndSounds(newGameState);
Logic Explanation
The new condition ensures that handleGameEndSounds is only called when:

Player dies (newGameState === 'dead') - Always play death sound
Player wins AND it's actually the end of the game:
For custom mazes (not 16x10): Always play victory sound (maintains backward compatibility)
For level system mazes (16x10): Only play victory sound when there are no more levels (!gameState.levelManager.hasNextLevel())
Result
✅ Victory sound now only plays when completing the final level (level 5)
✅ Door slam sound plays when advancing between levels (levels 1→2, 2→3, 3→4, 4→5)
✅ Custom mazes still work correctly (backward compatibility maintained)
✅ All existing tests pass
✅ Updated TODO.md to mark the issue as resolved
The fix ensures that players will only hear the satisfying victory sound when they truly complete the entire game, making the audio experience much more meaningful and rewarding.
