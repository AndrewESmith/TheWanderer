const beforeMovesText = await page.locator('.hud span').filter({ hasText: /Moves:/ }).textContent();
const beforeMoves = extractNumber(beforeMovesText);

await page.keyboard.press(direction);
await page.waitForTimeout(50);
How do I fix the following problem in the above code?: Argument of type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
  Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'.

The issue is that page.keyboard.press() expects a string parameter, but TypeScript is inferring that direction could be undefined. This happens because the array indexing with [i % 4] could theoretically return undefined in TypeScript's type system.

Here's the fix - you need to ensure TypeScript knows the value will always be a string:

The fix uses as const to create a readonly tuple type, which tells TypeScript that the array has exactly 4 elements and they're all string literals. This ensures that accessing any index with modulo 4 will always return a valid string, eliminating the TypeScript error.

The as const assertion creates a more specific type that prevents TypeScript from widening the array type to string[], which could theoretically be empty or have undefined elements.

Looking at the code, I can see that the TypeScript error is still occurring because page.keyboard.press() expects a string but the direction variable is being inferred as potentially undefined.

The issue is that even with as const, TypeScript is still concerned about the array access. Let me check the specific line and provide a more robust fix:

I see the issue. The problem is that TypeScript is still not confident that the array access will always return a valid string. Let me provide a more explicit type assertion to fix this:

The fix adds as string type assertions to explicitly tell TypeScript that the array access will always return a string. This is safe because:

The arrays are defined with exactly 4 elements
The modulo operation (% 4 or % directions.length) ensures the index is always 0, 1, 2, or 3
All elements in the arrays are string literals
This approach is more explicit than relying on TypeScript's inference and clearly communicates the intent that these values will always be valid strings for the page.keyboard.press() method.
