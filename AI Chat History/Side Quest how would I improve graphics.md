If I wanted to make the graphics more impressive in my code base the game The Wanderer what would I need to do?

If you want to make the graphics more impressive in The Wanderer (React/TypeScript), here are concrete, code-level options:

1. **Switch from DOM/CSS to Canvas or WebGL**  
   - Use `<canvas>` for 2D graphics (e.g., with [Konva](https://konvajs.org/) or [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/)).
   - For 3D or advanced 2D, use [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) (WebGL).

2. **Add Animations**  
   - Use [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for React-based UI/game element animations.
   - For canvas, animate sprites manually or with libraries.

3. **Use Sprite Sheets & Tilemaps**  
   - Replace simple shapes with pixel art or hand-drawn sprites.
   - Use a tool like [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) for map design, then render with a canvas engine.

4. **Lighting & Particle Effects**  
   - For 2D: Use canvas/WebGL for dynamic lighting, shadows, and particles.
   - For 3D: Three.js has built-in lighting, shadows, and post-processing.

5. **Sound & Visual Feedback**  
   - Add sound effects and visual cues for actions (e.g., hit flashes, screen shake).

6. **Upgrade Art Assets**  
   - Commission or create higher-quality sprites, backgrounds, and UI elements.

**How to start:**  
- If you’re using React DOM for rendering the maze/game, migrate the main game area to a `<canvas>` and render with PixiJS or Konva.
- If you want 3D, use Three.js and render the game world as a 3D scene.

**Dependencies to add (example for 2D with PixiJS):**
```bash
npm install pixi.js
```
**Or for 3D:**
```bash
npm install three
```

**Next steps:**  
- Tell me if you want 2D (canvas) or 3D (WebGL), and I’ll show you how to refactor your rendering code.  
- If you want to keep React DOM, focus on SVG and CSS animations, but you’ll hit limits fast.

**Summary:**  
Move rendering to canvas/WebGL, use better art, add effects/animations, and leverage specialized libraries for game graphics.  
Let me know your preferred direction (2D/3D, canvas/DOM, etc.) and I’ll give you code.

```shellscript
npm install pixi.js
```

```shellscript
npm install three
```
