I'll help you center align the HUD items. Let me first look at the current App.tsx file to see the HUD structure and styling.

Now let me check the CSS file to see the current HUD styling:

Let me also check the maze.css file to see if there's HUD styling there:

Perfect! I can see the current HUD structure. The HUD has a .hud-left section with the game information and a .hud-right section with audio controls. To center align all the items, I need to modify the CSS to center the content within each section.

Let me update the maze.css file to center align the HUD items:

Now I should also update the responsive section to maintain center alignment on smaller screens:

Perfect! I've updated the HUD styling to center align all items. Here's what I changed:

Added center alignment to .hud-left: Added align-items: center and justify-content: center to center the game information items (Score, Diamonds, Level, Moves) both vertically and horizontally within their container.

Added center alignment to .hud-right: Added justify-content: center to center the audio controls horizontally.

Updated responsive styles: Enhanced the mobile responsive section to ensure center alignment is maintained on smaller screens by adding align-items: center to the main .hud container and ensuring both left and right sections maintain their center alignment.

The changes will center align all HUD elements:

Score and Diamonds left will be center aligned
Level and Moves will be center aligned
Audio controls will be center aligned
All items maintain proper spacing with the existing gap: 10px
The layout will work well on both desktop and mobile devices, with the responsive design ensuring everything stays centered when the HUD switches to a vertical layout on smaller screens.
