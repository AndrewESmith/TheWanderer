I'll help you fix the failing test. Let me first examine the test file to understand what's happening with the boulder physics integration test.

Read file(s)

physics-integration-demo.test.ts
Now let me examine the physics engine to understand how boulder movement and sound events are generated:

Read file(s)

physics-engine.ts
Now let me check the collision detection module to see how boulder movement and sound events are generated:

Read file(s)

collision-detection.ts
Now I need to run the failing test to see the exact output and understand what's happening:

I can see the issue now. The tests are failing because the simulatePhysicsStep function (the legacy version) is not generating movement sounds for boulders. Looking at the physics engine code, I can see that the simulateGravity function calls simulateBoulderFall, but the movement sounds are supposed to be generated elsewhere.

Let me examine the simulateGravity function more closely. The issue is that the legacy simulateGravity function doesn't generate movement sounds - it only generates collision sounds from simulateBoulderFall. The movement sounds should be generated when a boulder actually moves.

Let me fix this by updating the simulateGravity function to generate movement sounds when boulders actually move:

Perfect! The tests are now passing. The issue was that the legacy simulateGravity function wasn't generating movement sounds when boulders actually moved. I fixed this by:

Adding movement sound generation: When a boulder actually moves (position changes), the function now generates a movement sound event with type: 'movement' and source: 'boulder'.

Checking for actual movement: The fix includes a check to see if the boulder's position actually changed (hasMoved = result.newPosition.x !== boulder.x || result.newPosition.y !== boulder.y) before generating the movement sound.

Maintaining collision sounds: The function still includes collision sounds from the simulateBoulderFall result, so both movement and collision sounds are properly generated.

The fix ensures that:

When boulders move, they generate movement sounds
When boulders collide with obstacles, they generate collision sounds
The string comparison for filtering sound events (event.type === 'movement' && event.source === 'boulder') works correctly
Multiple boulders each generate their own movement sounds when they fall
All four tests in the physics integration demo are now passing, demonstrating that boulder physics, sound generation, and game integration are working correctly.
