I want a how to play popup window when a player first runs the game. Please refer to the document #How to play.md for details on how the window should behave and the content to provide

I'll help you create a spec for the "How to Play" popup window feature. Let me first check if there's an existing spec for this feature and then create the requirements document.

Now I'll create a new spec for the "How to Play" popup window feature. Based on the requirements, this is a new feature that needs a comprehensive spec.

Created

requirements.md


Do the requirements look good? If so, we can move on to the design.

Great! Now I'll create the design document for the "How to Play" popup feature. Let me research the current codebase structure to understand how to integrate this feature effectively.

Now I'll create the design document based on my research of the codebase structure and existing patterns.

Does the design look good? If so, we can move on to the implementation plan.

Perfect! Now I'll create the implementation plan with actionable coding tasks based on the requirements and design.

Do the tasks look good?

Perfect! I've successfully created a comprehensive spec for the "How to Play" popup feature. The spec includes:

âœ… Completed Spec Documents
Requirements Document - Detailed user stories and acceptance criteria covering:

First-time user experience with automatic popup display
"Don't show again" preference management
Settings menu integration for reopening instructions
Comprehensive game instructions and credits
Visual design and accessibility requirements
Design Document - Technical architecture and implementation approach:

Component structure following existing patterns (AudioSettings modal)
Integration points with App.tsx and settings system
Local storage schema for preference persistence
Error handling and accessibility considerations
Visual design matching the game's dark retro theme
Implementation Plan - 12 actionable coding tasks:

TypeScript interfaces and type definitions
Settings management hook with localStorage
Content and popup components
CSS styling and responsive design
App integration and settings menu updates
Comprehensive testing strategy (unit, integration, E2E)
The spec is now ready for implementation! You can begin executing tasks by opening the tasks.md file and clicking "Start task" next to any task item. I recommend starting with Task 1 (TypeScript interfaces) as it provides the foundation for all other components.
