when the player moves the screen flickers can that be stopped?

I'll help you investigate and fix the screen flickering issue when the player moves. Let me first examine the current codebase to understand the rendering and movement systems.

Now I can see the issue! The screen flickering when the player moves is likely caused by the way the maze is being re-rendered. Looking at the code, I can identify several potential causes:

Force re-render on every move: The forceUpdate() call in movePlayer callback causes the entire component to re-render
Image reloading: Each Cell component has its own image loading state that resets on re-render
CSS grid recalculation: The maze grid might be recalculating layout on each render
Background image flickering: Images might be briefly removed and re-added during renders
Let me implement a solution to prevent this flickering:

Now let me add CSS optimizations to prevent layout shifts and improve rendering performance:

Now let me optimize the game state updates to reduce unnecessary re-renders:

Let me also add a performance optimization to prevent unnecessary maze grid recalculations:

Now let me add one more optimization to prevent the entire maze from re-rendering when only the game state changes:

Let me also add a CSS transition to make any remaining visual changes smoother:

Perfect! I've implemented several optimizations to eliminate the screen flickering when the player moves:

Key Changes Made:
1. Component Memoization
Added React.memo to the Cell component to prevent unnecessary re-renders
Added useMemo for stable styling and CSS classes
Memoized the maze grid rendering
2. CSS Performance Optimizations
Added transform: translateZ(0) to force hardware acceleration
Added backface-visibility: hidden to prevent flickering during transforms
Added will-change: background-image to hint the browser about upcoming changes
Added contain: layout style paint to isolate rendering to individual cells
Added smooth transitions for visual changes
3. Rendering Optimizations
Replaced forceUpdate() with a more stable updateTrigger state
Memoized maze dimensions calculation to prevent unnecessary recalculations
Added grid container optimizations with will-change: contents and contain: layout style
4. Image Loading Stability
Improved image loading state management to be more stable across re-renders
Added position coordinates to Cell component for better tracking
How This Fixes the Flickering:
Prevents Unnecessary Re-renders: Memoization ensures cells only re-render when their actual content changes
Hardware Acceleration: CSS transforms move rendering to the GPU, making updates smoother
Stable Background Images: Images no longer get removed and re-added during renders
Layout Containment: Each cell's rendering is isolated, preventing cascade effects
Smooth Transitions: Any remaining visual changes are smoothed with CSS transitions
The screen should now update smoothly when the player moves without any flickering. The optimizations maintain all existing functionality while significantly improving the visual experience.
