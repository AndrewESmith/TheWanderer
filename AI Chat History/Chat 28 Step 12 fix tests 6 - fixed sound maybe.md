# Chat 28 Step 12 fix tests 6 - fixed sound maybe

## User Request
The user asked me to fix a test failure in `src/tests/react-sound-integration.test.tsx` where a spy was expected to be called with arguments `['test-sound', undefined]` but had 0 calls.

## Initial Problem Analysis
The test failure was in the "should recover from temporary errors" test case. The issue was that after calling `resetAudioSystem()`, the `mockAudioManager.playSound` mock wasn't being called, suggesting that the reset was creating a new audio manager instance but the test was still checking the old mock reference.

## First Fix Attempt
I initially tried to fix this by:
1. Moving the mock reset after `resetAudioSystem()`
2. Adding `await` to `resetAudioSystem()`
3. Reordering operations to reset first, then clear mock, then test

However, this didn't work because the fundamental issue was that `resetAudioSystem()` creates a completely new audio manager instance via the factory, but our test was still referencing the old mock.

## Second Fix Attempt
I updated the mock setup to properly handle reinitialization:

1. **Updated factory mock**: Changed from simple function returns to proper mocked functions that always return the current `mockAudioManager` instance.

```typescript
// Before
vi.mock("../audio/managers/audio-manager-factory", () => ({
  createAudioManager: () => mockAudioManager,
  createSpecificAudioManager: () => mockAudioManager,
}));

// After
const mockFactory = {
  createAudioManager: vi.fn(() => mockAudioManager),
  createSpecificAudioManager: vi.fn(() => mockAudioManager),
};
vi.mock("../audio/managers/audio-manager-factory", () => mockFactory);
```

2. **Updated test logic**: Created a new mock manager with fresh mocks before calling `resetAudioSystem()`:

```typescript
// Create a new mock for after reset - this will be used by the new manager instance
const newPlaySoundMock = vi.fn();

// Update the mock manager that will be returned by the factory
mockAudioManager = {
  ...createMockAudioManager(),
  playSound: newPlaySoundMock,
};

await act(async () => {
  await result.current.resetAudioSystem();
});

// Should work now
act(() => {
  result.current.playSound("test-sound");
});

expect(newPlaySoundMock).toHaveBeenCalledWith("test-sound", undefined);
```

## Additional E2E Test Fix
The user then asked about a different test failure in `src/tests/sound-system-e2e.test.ts` where `expected +0 to be 10` for played sounds count.

### Problem Analysis
The issue was that `mockAudioContext.getPlayedSounds()` was returning 0 sounds when it should return 10. This was because:
1. The mock wasn't properly tracking when `start()` was called on buffer sources
2. The WebAudioManager might not have been finding the loaded sound buffers

### E2E Test Fixes
1. **Improved buffer source tracking**:
```typescript
createBufferSource() {
    const source = {
        // ... other properties
        start: vi.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
            // Mark this source as started when start() is called
            (source as any)._started = true;
        }),
        // ... other properties
    };
    this.bufferSources.push(source);
    return source;
}
```

2. **Updated getPlayedSounds method**:
```typescript
getPlayedSounds() {
    return this.bufferSources.filter(source => (source as any)._started === true);
}
```

3. **Ensured proper sound loading**:
```typescript
// Mock the sound as loaded in the manager's internal state
if ((manager as any).state && (manager as any).state.soundBuffers) {
    (manager as any).state.soundBuffers.set(SOUND_IDS.PLAYER_WALK, mockBuffer);
}

// Also ensure the sound is marked as loaded
if ((manager as any).state && (manager as any).state.loadedSounds) {
    (manager as any).state.loadedSounds.add(SOUND_IDS.PLAYER_WALK);
}
```

4. **Added getGainNodes method** for cleanup testing:
```typescript
getGainNodes() {
    return this.gainNodes;
}
```

## Key Insights
1. **Mock Factory Pattern**: When testing systems that create new instances via factories, you need to mock the factory itself, not just the instances.

2. **State Tracking**: For complex mocks like AudioContext, you need to properly track state changes (like when `start()` is called) to verify behavior.

3. **Internal State Access**: Sometimes you need to directly manipulate internal state of objects under test to ensure proper test conditions.

4. **Async Reset Operations**: When testing reset/reinitialization functionality, ensure you properly await async operations and update mocks between test phases.

## Final Status
Both test fixes should now work:
- The React integration test properly handles audio system reset by updating the mock factory and creating fresh mocks for the new manager instance
- The E2E test properly tracks played sounds by marking buffer sources as started and ensuring sound buffers are loaded in the manager's internal state

The fixes ensure that the mocks accurately reflect the behavior of the real audio system while providing the necessary hooks for test verification.
