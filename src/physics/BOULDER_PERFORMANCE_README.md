**Purpose**: Optimize proximity detection for scenarios with many boulders.

**Key Features**:
- Grid-based spatial partitioning for O(1) proximity queries
- Configurable cell size for different maze scales
- Efficient adjacent boulder detection using spatial locality

**Performance Benefits**:

- Scales well with maze size and boulder count
- Memory efficient with sparse grid representation

### 2. Optimized Boulder State Manager

**Purpose**: Provide caching and efficient state management for boulder operations.

**Key Features**:
- Position-based caching with automatic invalidation
- Spatial index integration for fast proximity queries
- Performance statistics tracking
- Memory usage monitoring

**Performance Benefits**:
- Cached results for repeated queries
- Reduced computational overhead for state filtering
- Automatic cache invalidation on state changes

### 3. Performance Integration Layer (`boulder-performance-integration.ts`)

**Purpose**: Integrate optimizations with existing boulder system while maintaining compatibility.

**Key Features**:
- Drop-in replacement for standard boulder state manager
- Performance monitoring and recommendations
- Automatic optimization for large mazes
- Memory usage tracking and optimization suggestions

**Performance Benefits**:
- Seamless integration with existing code

## Performance Characteristics

### Spatial Index Performance

| Operation                           | Standard | Optimized | Improvement      |
| ----------------------------------- | -------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| Proximity Detection (100 boulders)  | O(n)     | O(k)      | ~10x faster      |
| Proximity Detection (1000 boulders) | O(n)     | O(k)      | ~100x faster     |
| Memory Usage                        | O(n)     | O(n + g)  | Minimal overhead |

Where:
- n = number of boulders
- k = average boulders per grid cell (typically 1-5)
- g = number of grid cells (typically n/k)

### Caching Performance

| ----------------------- | ---------- | --------- | --------------- |
| Get Moving Boulders     | O(n)       | O(1)      | ~n times faster |
| Get Stationary Boulders | O(n)       | O(1)      | ~n times faster |
| Get Triggered Boulders  | O(n)       | O(1)      | ~n times faster |

### Batch Processing Performance

| Batch Size | Processing Time | Memory Usage | Recommended For  |
| ---------- | --------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| 1          | Highest         | Lowest       | Small operations |
| 10         | Medium          | Medium       | General use      |
| 50         | Lower           | Higher       | Large operations |
| 100+       | Lowest          | Highest      | Bulk operations  |

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { PerformanceOptimizedBoulderSystem } from './boulder-performance-integration';

// Initialize with maze
const performanceSystem = new PerformanceOptimizedBoulderSystem(maze, moveNumber);

// Use optimized proximity detection
const adjacentBoulders = performanceSystem.detectAdjacentBoulders(playerPosition);

// Get performance statistics
const stats = performanceSystem.getPerformanceStats();
console.log(`Total boulders: ${stats.system.totalBoulders}`);
console.log(`Operations per second: ${stats.current?.operationsPerSecond}`);
```

### Advanced Usage

```typescript
// Batch process boulder operations
const results = performanceSystem.processBoulderOperations(
    boulders,
    (boulder) => calculateSomething(boulder),
    20 // batch size
);

// Get optimization recommendations
const recommendations = performanceSystem.getOptimizationRecommendations();
if (recommendations.severity === 'high') {
    console.warn('Performance issues detected:', recommendations.recommendations);
}

// Monitor memory usage
const memoryUsage = performanceSystem.getMemoryUsage();
if (memoryUsage.estimatedBytes > 1000000) {
    console.warn('High memory usage detected');
}
```

### Large Maze Optimization

```typescript
// Automatically optimize for large mazes
performanceSystem.optimizeForLargeMaze(largeMaze);

// Check for maze changes and update caches
if (performanceSystem.checkMazeChanges(newMaze)) {
    console.log('Maze changed, caches updated');
}
```

## Performance Monitoring

### Metrics Tracked

1. **Proximity Detection Time**: Time spent on adjacent boulder detection
2. **State Management Time**: Time spent on boulder state updates
3. **Physics Simulation Time**: Time spent on physics calculations
4. **Operations Per Second**: Overall system throughput
5. **Memory Usage**: Estimated memory consumption

### Performance Thresholds

| Metric              | Good    | Warning   | Critical |
| ------------------- | ------- | --------- | -------- |
| Proximity Detection | < 1ms   | 1-5ms     | > 5ms    |
| State Management    | < 5ms   | 5-10ms    | > 10ms   |
| Memory Usage        | < 100KB | 100KB-1MB | > 1MB    |
| Operations/Second   | > 1000  | 100-1000  | < 100    |

### Optimization Recommendations

The system provides automatic recommendations based on performance metrics:

- **Low Severity**: Performance is optimal
- **Medium Severity**: Minor optimizations suggested (e.g., adjust batch sizes)
- **High Severity**: Major optimizations needed (e.g., implement boulder culling)

## Implementation Details

### Spatial Index Algorithm

```typescript
// Grid cell calculation
const cellX = Math.floor(position.x / cellSize);
const cellY = Math.floor(position.y / cellSize);
const cellKey = `${cellX},${cellY}`;

// Proximity search (check adjacent cells)
for (let dx = -1; dx <= 1; dx++) {
    for (let dy = -1; dy <= 1; dy++) {
        const checkCellKey = `${cellX + dx},${cellY + dy}`;
        // Check boulders in this cell
    }
}
```

### Caching Strategy

```typescript
// Cache key includes state type and move number
const cacheKey = `${stateType}_${moveNumber}`;

// Cache invalidation on state changes
if (stateChanged) {
    this.positionCache.clear();
    this.isDirty = true;
}
```

### Memory Management

- **Position Tracking**: Uses Set<string> for O(1) lookups
- **Cache Management**: Automatic cleanup of old cache entries
- **Performance History**: Limited to last 100 metrics to prevent memory growth
- **Spatial Index**: Sparse representation to minimize memory usage

## Testing

### Performance Tests

The system includes comprehensive performance tests covering:

1. **Spatial Index Tests**: Verify correctness and performance of spatial indexing
2. **Caching Tests**: Validate cache behavior and invalidation
3. **Batch Processing Tests**: Test batch operations and error handling
4. **Large Scale Tests**: Stress testing with large mazes and many boulders
5. **Memory Tests**: Validate memory usage and cleanup

### Benchmarks

Performance benchmarks are included to ensure optimizations provide measurable improvements:

- Proximity detection with varying boulder counts
- State management operations with different cache scenarios
- Memory usage under different load conditions

## Best Practices

### When to Use Optimizations

1. **Large Mazes**: Mazes with > 100x100 cells
2. **Many Boulders**: Scenarios with > 50 boulders
3. **Frequent Proximity Checks**: Games with rapid player movement
4. **Performance Critical**: Applications requiring consistent frame rates

### Configuration Guidelines

1. **Spatial Index Cell Size**: 
   - Small mazes (< 50x50): cellSize = 3
   - Medium mazes (50x50 to 100x100): cellSize = 5
   - Large mazes (> 100x100): cellSize = 10

2. **Batch Size**:
   - Small operations: batchSize = 10
   - Medium operations: batchSize = 20
   - Large operations: batchSize = 50

3. **Cache Management**:
   - Clear caches every 1000 operations
   - Monitor memory usage and adjust cache sizes accordingly

### Performance Monitoring

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Check performance metrics every 100 operations
2. **Threshold Alerts**: Set up alerts for performance degradation
3. **Memory Monitoring**: Track memory usage and implement cleanup as needed
4. **Optimization Reviews**: Regularly review and apply optimization recommendations

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Multi-threading**: Parallel processing for large boulder operations
2. **GPU Acceleration**: Use WebGL for proximity calculations
3. **Predictive Caching**: Cache likely-to-be-needed results
4. **Dynamic Optimization**: Automatically adjust parameters based on performance
5. **Compression**: Compress cached data to reduce memory usage

### Scalability Considerations

1. **Very Large Mazes**: Consider hierarchical spatial indexing
2. **Thousands of Boulders**: Implement level-of-detail systems
3. **Real-time Requirements**: Add frame-time budgeting
4. **Memory Constraints**: Implement streaming and paging systems
