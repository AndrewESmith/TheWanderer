- [x] Investigate memories
~~- [ ] How might we use cursor rules?~~ Lets look at Agent Steering

## Version 2

- [ ] Deploy the game!
  
## Version 3 - Add another dynamic

~~- [ ] Items in a maze should describe thems selves and their behaviour. Write a specification for the appropriate Interfaces, and methods.~~ Decided to let AI manage code. Also to look to Agent Steering
