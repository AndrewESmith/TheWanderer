# Player Movement Fix

## Problem Identified
The player wasn't moving because the React component wasn't re-rendering after game state changes. The issue was:

1. `gameState` was created once with `React.useState()` and never updated
2. `gameState.movePlayer()` modifies internal state but doesn't trigger React re-renders
3. The component had no way to know the game state had changed

## Root Cause
```typescript
// PROBLEM: gameState object reference never changes
const [gameState, _] = React.useState(() => createGameState(...));

// This modifies internal state but React doesn't know about it
gameState.movePlayer(dx, dy);
```

## Solution Applied
Added a force re-render mechanism using `useReducer`:

```typescript
// Added force update mechanism
const [, forceUpdate] = React.useReducer(x => x + 1, 0);

const movePlayer = React.useCallback((dx: number, dy: number) => {
  // Call the GameState method
  gameState.movePlayer(dx, dy);
  
  // Force re-render to reflect game state changes
  forceUpdate();
  
  // ... rest of the logic
}, [gameState, stopAllSounds, stableMazeRef, forceUpdate]);
```

## How It Works
1. `useReducer` creates a counter that increments on each call
2. `forceUpdate()` increments the counter, triggering a re-render
3. React re-renders the component with the updated game state
4. Player position and maze changes are now visible immediately

## Result
- Player now moves immediately on keypress
- Game state updates are reflected in the UI
- No flickering issues remain
- Responsive input without delay

The fix ensures that React knows when the game state has changed and re-renders the component accordingly, making player movement visible and responsive.
