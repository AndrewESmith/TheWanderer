# The Wanderer

This game called The Wanderer is based upon an Amiga game [The Wanderer](https://openretro.org/game/736fedbc-ca4b-4a6c-9651-37efdf5adc98/edit#5c6e78f8-8b33-5aa5-8799-0deab5b2b517) ([see also](https://www.video-games-museum.com/en/game/Wanderer-The/82/3/72080)) 

## History

The game came into existence in 1991 and appears to have its origins in a MS-DOS 1988 game of the same name by a company called [mobygames.com](https://www.bing.com/images/search?view=detailV2&ccid=njwql2Qp&id=04C132F7383528DA105C45DF0D508F62A127889A&thid=OIP.njwql2Qpr9H6DoilpbylyQHaEo&mediaurl=https%3a%2f%2fcdn.mobygames.com%2ffbae36b6-aba5-11ed-bd13-02420a00019c.webp&exph=375&expw=600&q=wanderer+game+1980s&simid=607987363899065693&FORM=IRPRST&ck=9914B4738DB45F49737A7C21A52A1122&selectedIndex=0&itb=0&idpp=overlayview&ajaxhist=0&ajaxserp=0)

This Game has been created using AI, React and TypeScript. The instructions and images provided to the AI can be found under the folder _Instructions_.

- `.env.development` - Loaded in development mode with debug features enabled
- `.env.production` - Loaded in production builds with debug features disabled

**Note**: This project was migrated from Create React App, so any legacy `REACT_APP_*` variables need to be updated to use the `VITE_*` prefix. See [MigrateToVite.md](./MigrateToVite.md) for migration details.

## Architecture

This project follows modern TypeScript and React best practices:

### Functional Programming Patterns
- **Pure Functions**: All game logic uses pure functions with no side effects
- **Immutable State**: Game state updates create new objects rather than mutating existing ones
- **Functional Components**: React components use hooks instead of classes
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all game entities

### Code Organization
- **Interface-First Design**: TypeScript interfaces define contracts before implementation
- **Modular Structure**: Each file contains related functionality with clear separation of concerns
- **Descriptive Naming**: Variables use auxiliary verbs (isLoading, hasError) for clarity
- **Named Exports**: Functions use named exports for better tree-shaking

### Testing Strategy
- **Vitest Integration**: Modern testing framework with native TypeScript support
- **Functional Testing**: Tests focus on pure function behavior and state transitions
- **End-to-End Coverage**: Playwright tests verify complete user workflows
- **Type-Safe Tests**: All tests use proper TypeScript interfaces

### Audio Architecture

- **Event-Driven Audio**: Sound events generated by game logic and processed by audio system
- **Context Management**: Proper AudioContext lifecycle management with user interaction handling
- **Asset Loading**: Intelligent sound asset preloading with error recovery
- **Settings Integration**: User-configurable audio settings with persistent preferences

### Physics Architecture  
- **Boulder State Management**: Comprehensive tracking of boulder movement states and triggers
- **Collision Detection System**: Multi-layered collision detection with different interaction types
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient algorithms for handling multiple concurrent physics objects
- **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling with fallback mechanisms for physics edge cases
- **Continuous Simulation**: Real-time physics updates with proper state synchronization

### Level Management Architecture
- **Validation System**: Built-in level validation with automatic error detection and repair
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Intelligent difficulty scaling across multiple levels
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive fallback mechanisms for level loading failures
- **State Persistence**: Proper level progression tracking and state management

## Game Mechanics

The game follows specific behavior rules for all elements:

### Player Movement
- Move in four directions using WASD or arrow keys
- Interact with various game elements

### Object Interactions
- **Boulders**: Move downward when triggered, can be fatal to player
- **Arrows**: Move in their pointing direction when triggered
- **Diamonds**: Must collect all to enable the exit
- **Soil**: Disappears when the player moves through it
- **Bombs**: Fatal to player if touched
