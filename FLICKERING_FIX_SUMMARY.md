# Player Movement Flickering Fix Summary

## Problem
The game was experiencing flickering when the player moved, caused by unnecessary re-renders of the maze grid and individual cells.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Maze re-rendering**: The entire maze grid was re-rendering on every player movement
2. **Cell component re-renders**: Individual cells were re-rendering when only player position changed
3. **Image reloading**: Images were being reloaded unnecessarily on each render
4. **Multiple state updates**: Sequential state updates were causing multiple render cycles

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Image Caching System
- Added global image cache (`imageCache.current`) to prevent reloading images
- Images are cached after first successful load
- Cells check cache before attempting to load images

### 2. Enhanced Cell Memoization
- Improved `React.memo` comparison function for Cell components
- Cells only re-render when their base type actually changes (not just player overlay)
- Prevented unnecessary re-renders when only player position changes

### 3. Deferred Player Position Updates
- Used `React.useDeferredValue` for player position to reduce flickering during rapid movements
- Player position updates are deferred to prevent blocking critical renders

### 4. Batched State Updates
- Wrapped state updates in `React.startTransition` to batch non-urgent updates
- Prevents multiple render cycles from sequential state changes

### 5. Maze Rendering Optimization
- Removed player position dependency from maze grid memoization
- Maze only re-renders when structure actually changes (level changes, physics)
- Added maze container with performance optimizations

### 6. CSS Performance Enhancements
- Added hardware acceleration properties to prevent flickering
- Enhanced containment properties for better rendering isolation
- Optimized player cell styling with z-index and positioning

### 7. Function Memoization
- Memoized image loading function to prevent recreation on each render
- Stable references for frequently used functions

## Technical Details

### Key Changes in App.tsx:
- Added image caching system
- Implemented deferred player position updates
- Enhanced Cell component memoization
- Batched state updates with `React.startTransition`
- Optimized maze rendering dependencies

### Key Changes in maze.css:
- Added `.maze-container` with performance optimizations
- Enhanced `.cell` styling with anti-flicker properties
- Improved player cell styling

## Expected Results
- Smooth player movement without visual flickering
- Reduced CPU usage during player movement
- Better overall game performance
- Maintained visual quality and responsiveness

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test rapid player movement (holding arrow keys)
2. Test movement in different directions
3. Test on different devices/browsers
4. Monitor performance metrics during gameplay

The optimizations maintain the existing game functionality while significantly reducing flickering through strategic rendering optimizations and caching mechanisms.
